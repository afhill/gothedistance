Yes, I'm one of those folks who endeavors to run a marathon in every state, and join the 50 States Marathon Club. Sure, I could join now as a standard member (having completed at least 10 states), but I'm going to wait for a bit longer before really jumping in.

As of July 2019, I've completed 21 states and 3 provinces.
