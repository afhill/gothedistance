They say that all you need to run is a pair of shoes. While that may technically be true, we all have our preferences. Here are a few of my favourite running-related things.

**Watch/HRM &#8211; [Garmin](http://www.garmin.com)**. Several years ago, I purchased a FitSense HRM. It had a foot pod instead of using GPS technology. I thought that would enable me to use it on a treadmill. However, I never managed to calibrate it completely. In 2007 I finally succumbed to a Garmin 305 and I adore it. Even when I run inside, I wear the HRM despite the fact it can&#8217;t calculate my pace in real time.

**Socks &#8211; [Smartwool](http://www.smartwool.com)**. Some people aren&#8217;t passionate about socks. I&#8217;m not one of those people. My love affair with smartwool started back in 2000. A friend and I had started an online magazine and she wrote to the folks at smartwool to ask if we could have product samples to review on an upcoming European backpacking trip. They sent us several pairs of socks as well as a dvd with product information.  
Often, women have one choice for sock size: 7-9. I wear a size 6, so I often have trouble with socks slipping down. Smartwool actually makes socks of different sizes, so I can actually get a pair that fits! (The original review we wrote for smartwool is available via the [wayback machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20001216070000/www.jaggedmag.com/travel_smartwool.html)). Another favorite is my hook-up for my smartwool socks. I consistently purchase from [The Sock Company](http://thesockcompany.com/), which offers socks at a discount. The last time I purchased from them, one item was on back-order and eventually discontinued. I was offered either a refund or an alternative item. I requested an alternative item, and was given an increased discount in anticipation of a future price adjustment.

They just seem to fit better than anything else out there, regardless of my other needs. Before I determined the type of shoe I needed in terms of motion control or cushioning, I would just go to a store and grab a pair of sauconys. Eventually I settled on the Omni Moderate 5, and I&#8217;ve been quite faithful to that model. After several pairs, I moved up to the Omni Moderate 6, which I didn&#8217;t like as much. In the fall of 2008 I finally made the leap up to the Omni Moderate 7. I&#8217;ve experimented with width and the amount of support (ultimate rather than moderate), and in general, all have been fine.

**Hydration System: [Camelbak](http://www.camelbak.com)**: When I was preparing for my 50K in March 2006, I purchased a camelbak hydration system. While the sloshing took a bit of getting used to, it was very helpful to be hands-free and have a place to store my keys, any snacks, tissues, etc. I also have some camelbak-brand water bottles that I use regularly.  
With the recent controversy about BPA in bottles, I was doing some research online. I found that while the camelbak bladders don&#8217;t have any BPA issues, one of my bottles did. Camelbak has since released BPA-free bottles. I found a tweet by [Alli Crumley](http://twitter.com/mrscrumley/statuses/802066643) in which she stated that camelbak had sent her a new bottle after she had blogged about having to throw hers away. It is just that sort of attention to customers that really fuels my appreciation for a brand. I was already a fan of camelbak (which is why I was searching tweetscan for it to begin with), but this further cemented my like for them.

**Non-slip thingies &#8211; [Yaktrax](http://www.yaktrax.com)**: It&#8217;s hard to describe a category for yaktrax, because their brand name is often used to describe the category itself. Yaktrax are attached to your shoes to prevent you from slipping in the winter. I have friends who have other products to serve this purpose, but Yaktrax are definitely the best known.  
Similar to the story about camelbak above, the day I posted about getting my yaktrax, I received a [comment](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/03/now-thats-dedication-guy-watching-me-run-by-outside/#comments) from representatives from the company. It really impressed me (and I [blogged about it again](http://www.afhill.com/blog/2008/03/08/a-perfect-example/)!). It&#8217;s that level of customer service that makes me an even stronger brand advocate.

I much prefer the ideals behind the Clif line of products. I like the idea that I can pronounce and recognize the ingredient names. But Gu is on my list of favorites for a few good reasons: it tastes good, and it works.  
Gu is easy to carry and easy to eat. My Mom even mixes her Gu with water in a bottle before taking it for a run, and describes it as drinking a chocolate milkshake. I&#8217;ve tried clif, I&#8217;ve tried powergel (although the recent versions are more palatable), but in the end, I gravitate towards the Gu. I recently bought an entire box, since I know I go through 3 Gus per marathon. I used to always get the fruit flavoured ones (tri-berry, tangerine), but recently was introduced to the chocolate, which is pretty good as well!

**Rehydration beverage: [Gatorade](http://gatorade.com/)**: I&#8217;m quite sure that several years ago, powerade had high fructose corn syrup, but gatorade did not*. That was my primary reason for never really supporting powerade. Recently a glance at a gatorade list of ingredients shows that it too has high fructose corn syrup, but I&#8217;m at a loss for alternatives. I tend to like grape or strawberry, but I tend to buy an assortment of flavours.

* I found [this article from 2004](http://www.karinya.com/sportsdrinks.htm) that lists the ingredients for both gatorade and powerade. It claims no HFCS in gatorade.
