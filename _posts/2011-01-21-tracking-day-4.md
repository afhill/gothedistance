For Christmas last year my folks got me a weighmax digital scale. I don&#8217;t use it for much more than weight but today I did the whole gamut.

Body fat: 21.3  
Water: 54.6%  
muscle: 34%

Was talking with a coworker about protein (and introduced her to hemp seed) and did a search for a calc and found a crazy one- this says I need 110g to gain muscle?? http://www.muscle-gain-tips.com/muscle-building-nutrition/protein-intake-calculator

I was starving this afternoon!!

After work I went to &#8220;yoga for athletes&#8221;. The instructor kept helping me with my hips. Pretty interesting bc I feel no pain but obviously it&#8217;s manifesting itself. I spoke with her afterwards and mentioned my injury and she welcomed me to bring anything I get from physical therapy to integrate into my practice.
