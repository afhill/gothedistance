Other than sleeping in (til 7:40, that&#8217;s sleeping in for me!), I felt decent after yesterday&#8217;s cheat day. However, I was NOT looking forward to the 5K race today. So I decided to just treat it as a pickup in a longer run. Still didn&#8217;t get in the whole 14 that I should have, but I&#8217;m up to 45 miles this week (up from 30 last week) so I&#8217;m content.

#### Food

&#8211; Tea  
&#8211; Kashi nugget cereal with kefir, hemp seed, blueberries  
&#8211; Coffee and hot cocoa post-run (this is ok, remember?)  
&#8211; Honey milk  
&#8211; [Easy green quinoa salad](http://www.choosingraw.com/easy-green-quinoa-bowl/) &#8211; I used dulse flakes and cilantro, no basil and much less than a cup of kale!  
&#8211; Greens+ bar  
&#8211; Black bean soup  
&#8211; Mediterranean veggie sandwich on multigrain (it had some feta on it)  
&#8211; Apple  
&#8211; [chip&#8217;ins Popcorn chips](http://www.popcornindiana.com/product_type/chip%27ins) (not an ideal snack)  
&#8211; Coconut lime chickpea curry with added tofu, quinoa  
&#8211; Veggie juice: cucumber, apple, parsley  
&#8211; mango

#### Exercise

&#8211; 8 miles running, with 3.1 as part of the Valentine&#8217;s Day 5K  
&#8211; 10 pushups  
&#8211; bench press: 30x45lbs, 30x55lbs, 20x60lbs, 15x55lbs, 15x45lbs.
