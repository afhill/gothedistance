I woke up at 5:30 today and I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore, I had to hit the gym! I tried to tell myself that my coach said nothing til the weekend and Friday=the weekend!?!

However, I went out with the RRBs and the Striders last night and I&#8217;m pretty sure Lydia mentioned doing plyometrics with Colleen, so apparently there is some exercising going on by other marathoners??

As it was, I left my legs alone and just continued to work on my bench press. The [Pump and Run](http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/home/sports-and-events/pump-and-run.html) is my next target event, on March 4th. 

I want to be able to bench 30x80lbs, then run a sub-20 5K. Based on the results from the previous few years, if I can max out the bench and run a sub-20, I&#8217;ll definitely place. Last year, that&#8217;d be an outright win. But based on the results from the past few years, some of the top contenders didn&#8217;t run in 2011. I know at least one will be there, as we&#8217;ve connected on Facebook and Twitter and I know [MsPumpnRun](http://twitter.com/mspumpnrun) is gunning for a sub-20 time and top-5 placement as well!

</div>Today I went into the bench press like it will be at the Arnold Classic, no warmup reps. I did 10 pushups, 20 jumping jacks and then loaded my weight. I did 12x80lbs, which is the first time I&#8217;ve even tried more than 5 reps at a time. I then did 10x80lbs and then 2x(9x80lbs), so I think I&#8217;m in good shape. I then dropped the weight and did 20x55lbs. After that my chest and arms were pretty well toast, so I did a few triceps and chest exercises but nothing too impressive. 

Some guy saw me struggling during my 9-reps and asked if I needed a spot. I appreciated the offer, but I declined. I&#8217;m perfectly ok with slowly lowering the bar to my body and hoisting myself up out of it. ðŸ™‚ For some reason, a spotter makes me more willing to quit! 

Goal-wise, I&#8217;m happy with where I am. I have 6 weeks til the competition. I figure I will aim to increase by 5 reps each week so that I can get up over the 30. I also haven&#8217;t been creatining for a couple weeks as I&#8217;ve been tapering/recovering and I&#8217;m going to get back into that full-force. Yesterday I also bought some [Gaspari SuperPump](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/gn/super.html) so let&#8217;s see if that helps me see some gains!

I was wearing my marathon maniacs singlet at the gym and as I got ready to leave, a woman in the locker room asked if I competed. I was a bit confused, and said that yeah, I ran marathons. She motioned to my arms and said I was ripped. She actually meant fitness/figure competitions! We had a nice chat about diet and such, she did a show a few years ago and is trying to get back to it now. It was a really nice complement: she said she&#8217;d noticed me at the gym before and just figured I competed, and couldn&#8217;t wait til she had definition like me! 

#### Food

&#8211; PROBAR Superfood Slam  
&#8211; Vega pre-workout sports optimizer with creatine and BCAAs  
&#8211; Vega sports protein optimizer with creatine and BCAAs  
&#8211; Ezekiel cereal with almond milk and hemp seeds  
&#8211; falafel, hummus, tomato, greens, hemp seed on a whole wheat tortilla  
&#8211; unsweetened, non-fat earl grey latte from *$  
&#8211; [spicy pumpkin soup](http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/spicy_pumpkin_soup/) (subbing coconut milk for the milk, cream and sugar) with Ezekiel bread  
&#8211; Amazing meal in almond milk  
&#8211; apple  
&#8211; whole wheat tortilla with sauteed veggies (peppers, squash, zucchini), avocado, tomato and quorn chickn  
&#8211; a couple bites of [clean cinnamon rolls](http://www.thegraciouspantry.com/clean-eating-cinnamon-rolls/). These were an adventure! I started making them before considering the fact I don&#8217;t have a rolling pin, OR much counter space! Then I didn&#8217;t knead the dough enough so the whole &#8220;roll&#8221; didn&#8217;t really happen.. so, it&#8217;s more like a cinnamon loaf. Tastes all right &#8211; but you can tell it&#8217;s whole wheat, and doesn&#8217;t quite live up to my &#8220;gobs of cream cheese topping&#8221; cinnamon roll standards. Still, there&#8217;s a lot of honey in them so although they&#8217;re officially considered clean, I&#8217;m not going to gorge myself on them.

#### Exercise

&#8211; bench press  
&#8211; pushups: 10 regular, 2x(10) bench, 20 bosu  
&#8211; random triceps stuff  
&#8211; weak chest exercises

Tonight I watched &#8220;Fat Sick and Nearly Dead&#8221;, a documentary about some guy who does travels across the country on a 60 day juice fast, transforms his life and inspires others. It was actually a bit less hokey than the trailer seems. It was no [Forks Over Knives](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/forks-over-knives/), but it wasn&#8217;t bad. I do try to do green smoothies, I just wonder about the protein aspect of only having juice for months like these folks did&#8230;
