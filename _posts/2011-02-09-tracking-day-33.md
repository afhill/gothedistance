So it turns out tracking via livestrong.com is nice for real-time feedback, but I really do like the daily roundup here. 

Today I worked out a lot, so tried to fuel up accordingly. What&#8217;s a lot, you ask? I went to the gym in the morning and worked my arms for about 45 min. Then after work I headed to Davis bootcamp, where we worked on&#8230; Arms! We did 6 stations for a minute each, then had a minute rest between the 4 rounds. We did bicep curls with squats, pike pushups, explosive pushups, woodchoppers, bounced a medicine ball off the wall, and threw the medicine ball and then bear-crawled after it. It was definitely the toughest workout I&#8217;ve done there yet! Then I headed to the Glitterdome (the Denver Roller Dolls practice space) for an hour of practice. I feel strong, but I am concerned I&#8217;ve lost some endurance. Tomorrow may need to have some good cardio!

Food-wise, I&#8217;m doing ok at &#8220;real food&#8221; (I read &#8220;[is &#8220;eat real food&#8221; unthinkable?](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/is-eat-real-food-unthinkable/) this morning), but I supplemented with some processed stuff. I had a protein shake AND a Mojo bar between bootcamp and skating. I wasn&#8217;t excited about the mojo bar but it was quick and easy. I&#8217;ve been great at preparing my lunches for work: next step is figuring out dinner for my nights out. 

Just bc I like it here:  
Breakfast: oatmeal, almond butter, hemp seed, blueberries  
Lunch: garbanzo stew, brown rice, steamed spinach  
Dinner: tuna on whole wheat pitettes, green pea guacamole and lentil chips  
Random other snacks: tons of fruit, fruitein protein shake, mojo bar, cottage cheese

I made the green pea guac from a recipe from the Eat Clean Diet. It was ok, but I think the avocados I used weren&#8217;t terribly flavorful: it tastes more like the peas and lemon than real guac :-/.  
I went and picked up a huge container of oats after work. I can&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re so cheap, while being so filling and good for you!
