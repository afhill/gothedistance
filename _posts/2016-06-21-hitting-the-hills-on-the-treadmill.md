It was 100F today!!! I knew I wasnt going to manage a 6pm hill workout in that heat, so I sit the &#8216;mill instead. 

The workout:  
10 min warmup  
8 hill repeats: 1 min\*4, 2min\*1, 1min*3.  
10 min cooldown

I kept the incline consistent, 5% grade everytime. For the 1 min repeats I set the treadmill at a 7:30 pace. For the 2min I set it at 8:00 for the first minute, then 7:30 for the second. For my last repeat, I sped it up to 7:00 for the last 30 seconds. 

The last few repeats were TOUGH&#8230; but I was glad to do them on the TM so it forced me to keep pushing at that pace!

In all, I completed 4 miles in 36:25. Not too shabby!
