For most folks training for a marathon, that&#8217;s not that unusual. But it&#8217;s been a LONG time since I set off for such a distance without a racing bib on!

So far my motivation to actually train for the [Rock n Roll Arizona](http://www.rnraz.com) marathon has held steady. Ok, so it&#8217;s only been a week&#8230; it&#8217;s all about celebrating even the smallest accomplishments! 

Once I figured out how many weeks I actually had til the race, I consulting my schedule. I had a target long run of 18miles at a 9:08 pace. I considered going to meet the training group, who had a planned 14 mile course, but I was concerned I&#8217;d get caught up with the pace of the group and struggle to get in the whole 18. So, I made an event of it: downloaded some new podcasts and the latest Taylor Swift album, and headed out!

Lately I&#8217;ve been running shorter and faster, and I was happy to find that I had to force myself to slow down. For the first time I finished the nice long loop by my place, which was close to 14.5miles. By that time the sun was nicely up and I stopped by the apartment to change into a t-shirt and head out again. Although I&#8217;d been flying right before the break, the short stop shook me out of it and I struggled a bit around mile 15-16. Luckily though I set up my small loop to take me down a nice descent coming into the homestretch and I was able to finish strong. 

Of note: around mile 7, my average pace was a 9:02. By the end, I finished with an 8:54 average. That&#8217;s 18 miles in 2:40:27. My average heart rate was 155, with a max of 172.

When I posted the elevation from my run in Kentucky, my Mom commented on the elevation change. I&#8217;d like to point out that my path around my apartment has about the same amount of change &#8211; but it starts about 5000ft higher!
