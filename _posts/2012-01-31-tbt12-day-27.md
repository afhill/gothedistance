#### Food

&#8211; Panera egg white, sundried tomato, spinach on multi-grain  
&#8211; fruit cup  
&#8211; coffee  
&#8211; probar superfood slam  
&#8211; sweet potato chips

Then I went to my bosses&#8217; place for dinner. I knew they&#8217;d planned a lobster dinner, so I was prepared for plenty of side dishes. But my boss picked up plenty of special food just for me! But I&#8217;d already decided to make it my cheat day, so&#8230;  
&#8211; cheese and crackers  
&#8211; red wine  
&#8211; cornbread  
&#8211; potato salad  
&#8211; cole slaw  
&#8211; falafel  
&#8211; Tabouli  
&#8211; chickpeas  
&#8211; edamame salad  
&#8211; red velvet cake

#### Exercise

&#8211; 5 mile run

I then got an email from my coach saying we were only supposed to run 4-5 days this week. Whoops!
