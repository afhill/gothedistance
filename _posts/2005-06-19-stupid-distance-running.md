Ran the Run for Pride 5K this morning &#8211; the only race I&#8217;ve ever done twice. At 23:21, my 2004 performance had been my slowest 5K since I started keeping track. I now have a new PW: 23:44.

I told myself not to go out too fast; and I didn&#8217;t. 

Mile 1: 7:18  
Mile 2: 7:49  
Mile 3.1: 8:37 (7:50/mile)

Generally I go out too fast and have to walk; I kept running throughout, but I still faded badly. Perhaps it IS a better strategy to go out fast, knowing I&#8217;ll be fading anyway&#8230;.
