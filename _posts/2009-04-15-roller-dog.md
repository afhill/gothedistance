### What&#8217;s up, dog?

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/snarles-225x300.jpg" alt="snarles" title="snarles" width="225" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-912" />](http://www.modlivin.com/best-in-show/)The third annual Mod Livin Best in Show contest started today, and our entrant, Snarles Barkley is counting on your vote. If you didn&#8217;t get to meet him during his visit to the Wagon Wheel last month, you can check him out in all his roller glory at <http://www.modlivin.com/best-in-show/>. He&#8217;s the 7th dog down (but he&#8217;s #1 in my heart).

PLEASE VOTE FOR SNARLES! Just go to <http://www.modlivin.com/best-in-show/>, scroll down to Snarles, click the radio button to his left, then scroll on down to the bottom, or back to the top and click Vote! And then tell your friends to do it. And your family. Enemies, even.

WHY AM I VOTING FOR SNARLES BARKLEY? Because he&#8217;s cute, he doesn&#8217;t stink or chew on your skates, and he&#8217;s housebroken. He also supports a very worthy cause, the Downtown Animal Care Foundation. Besides, who could say no to that face?

Please go to <http://www.modlivin.com/best-in-show/> today and vote for our dog!
