Today was the Steamboat Marathon, my 25th! While I finished a tough race in what is an acceptable time:

Gun time (no chips): 3:53:29  
Overall: 95/313  
Gender: 35/156  
Age Group: 7/33

I wasn&#8217;t happy with how it went, overall. I just didn&#8217;t have the energy mid-race; and yet when I smelled the barn, I was able to pick it up. I passed 5 or 6 women within the last mile, turning my fastest mile (other than during the 600 ft elevation drop in miles 5 and 6). While it&#8217;s good to have a finishing kick, I need to have a &#8220;during&#8221; kick as well!

I also noticed a disturbing trend in my 2009 races:  
Jan (Arizona): 3:29  
Feb (Last Chance): 3:35  
April (Boston): 3:47  
June (Steamboat): 3:53

I don&#8217;t like this slowing down, and I suspect I may know the culprit: the last time I did any real training for a race was that Arizona one. 

I already picked up the new second edition of &#8220;[Advanced Marathoning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0736074600?ie=UTF8&tag=digitliken-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0736074600)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=digitliken-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0736074600" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />&#8221; and started reading it last night in preparation for Twin Cities in the fall, and had been scheduled to start my 12 week plan on July 12th. Now I&#8217;m thinking that I will use the 5 weeks before that to do some Heart Rate Training (I&#8217;ve had [Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0915297256?ie=UTF8&tag=digitliken-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0915297256)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=digitliken-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0915297256" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> for years, but have never officially followed their schedule). 

I love running, but I think I&#8217;d love it more if I could overcome this downtime through miles 15-18..
