Last Sunday was a VERY important race! Not for me, but for my Mom. I&#8217;ve posted about her taking up running, and this past weekend it culminated in her first ever half marathon!

She has been going through various clinics at the [Running Room](http://www.runningroom.com/hm/), and really enjoying them. I think she really enjoyed being able to discuss things with me, as well &#8212; I had a few different opinions on some things, and was able to encourage her through my experiences. 

I wasn&#8217;t able to be there at the end of the race, obviously, but I asked my Dad to give her 13 roses at the end of the race from me. As the day grew closer I realized the event was actually going to be marked in kilometers so really I probably should have given her 21.. I ignored that fact ðŸ˜‰

I was so proud to get the call from her on Sunday, saying she really enjoyed it and would do it again. Good thing, as we already have Vegas on the calendar! She will run the half, and I&#8217;ll do the full. Family bonding at its finest ðŸ˜‰

From her email the next day:  
_&#8221; officially I finished (chip time) 2:19:41, Gender rank &#8211; 423/614, Division Rank 29/50 (50-59 years) &#8211; so kind of the middle of the pack for a mature lady who has really only been running for 18 months. Can hardly wait until I am 60, there were only 5 in that age group!  
  
Knees are a little sore tonight but other then that, feel great! Las Vegas, here we come!&#8221;

That&#8217;s my Mom&#8230; ðŸ™‚
