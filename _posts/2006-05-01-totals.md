I feel like I have been slacking on keeping track of my running as of late. I used to keep track of my mileage in excel as well as on paper, and I also post them on the runnersworld forums mileage game. Seeing Meredith&#8217;s monthly totals made me realize I haven&#8217;t really been keeping as close tabs as I used to. But I&#8217;m starting to get back into the habit of running at work and I&#8217;m thinking more about specific training runs to try to work on my speed, so I think things will turn around shortly. In the meantime, I looked through my weekly totals for April:

April 1: 13.1 (race)  
April 2-8: ? 9.2 maybe?  
April 9-15: 6.8  
April 16-22: 32.4 (26.2 race, 6.2 race)  
April 23-30: 12

&#8212;&#8212;-  
73.5?
