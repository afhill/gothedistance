This morning I went to the gym and did arms, then came back and decided to start the wii active 30 day challenge! I chose &#8220;high intensity&#8221; but everything is relative, right? Did some jogging in place, lunges, tricep and bicep work, boxing and &#8220;inline skating&#8221; (squats and jumps). It wasn&#8217;t anything too crazy but I was glad to have the silly avatar keeping me going. 

I also went to physical therapy, but that&#8217;s a post of its own.

This tracking has been really good at having me notice how much I &#8220;top-load&#8221; my meals. Especially when I have practice, I&#8217;m not really getting in a decent dinner. Probably not great for performance nor recovery. Something to work on!
