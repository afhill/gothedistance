Wow, I&#8217;m a blogging fool today!

Today was a great day to abuse my calves! First I did a treadmill workout in my Newtons &#8211; .25 miles warmup, then 3.5 miles @ 7:30, then .25 mile cooldown. My calves were definitely feeling it even during the run! 

Then I headed out to [Core Power Yoga](http://corepoweryoga.com/) &#8211; I&#8217;ve been meaning to go for awhile, and since I don&#8217;t have any travel planned for the next little while, I figured it was a good chance to give their &#8220;one-free-week&#8221; promotion a try! (A friend recommended me, so she gets a credit &#8211; if you live where there&#8217;s a studio and you want a free week, leave me a comment and I&#8217;ll get you a referral card)  
I attended one of their beginner classes (obviously), and wasn&#8217;t too overwhelmed with following along with all the poses! At the end of it I considered returning for another session a few hours later, but decided it was more prudent to see how a single session affected me. I did really enjoy, though, and will definitely be back!

So between the running and the yoga, my calves are feeling it! I just pulled on my recovery socks and are willing them to do their magic &#8211; particularly since I just carb-loaded for [a long trail run](http://www.inclineclub.com/faq.htm#SProto) in the morning to prep for Pike&#8217;s Peak!
