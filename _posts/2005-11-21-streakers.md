Just listening to Endurance radio&#8217;s interview with John Wallace.. he&#8217;s not even 30 yet, and he&#8217;s the VP of the [United States Running Streak Association](http://www.trizera.com/USRSA/). what&#8217;s that, you say? 

USRSA RUNNING STREAK DEFINITION:A running streak is defined by USRSA as running at least one continuous mile within each calendar day under one&#8217;s own body power (without the utilization of any type of health or mechanical aid other than prosthetic devices). 

He&#8217;s run at least a mile every day for the past 16 years. Including running across the country. [seejohnrun.com](http://seejohnrun.com)

and people say I&#8217;m crazy!!
