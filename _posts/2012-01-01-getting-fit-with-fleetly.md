When I first started lifting, I scoured bodybuilding.com for workout plans to figure out what to do at the gym. Lately, however, I&#8217;ve struggled a bit with my motivation in finding new exercises, or determining how hard to push myself. 

Enter [Fleetly](http://www.fleetly.com).

Frida first turned me onto the iPhone app, as a way to log workouts, sign up for challenges, and gain rewards and compete with friends. But as I started using the app, I found a feature that was much more compelling for me. There are a plethora of pre-existing workouts to choose from, based on goal or target body area.

When you start a workout, it gives you a description of the specific exercise (in some cases there is even a video to watch), a target weight and number of reps. You can just click &#8220;log&#8221; or change the numbers to your actual performance to submit. The next exercise is then queued up for you. You can also play playlists from your iTunes library or make a playlist on the fly to work out to.

There is a history tab that displays every exercise you do and the day you do it, so it&#8217;s easy to go back and repeat favorite exercises. Past results are displayed as well. There is also a &#8220;coach&#8221; option, which seems to increase the number of reps every time you try the exercise!

All in all, I&#8217;m pretty excited about this little app. I love to have a workout (including reps) planned out for me, and be able to monitor my progress. Interested? [Join up and let&#8217;s connect](http://www.fleetly.com/people/29382/)!
