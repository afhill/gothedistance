So I did one of those things you&#8217;re not supposed to last week. 

You know how marathon training plans call for long runs, often up to 20 miles? Last week I ran my first marathon of 2010 (late in the year for me!) and when I looked back at my training log, realized the longest run I&#8217;d done this year so far was the half marathon back in Jan.

Yup, in 2010 I&#8217;ve run one half marathon and one marathon, and everything else has been 10 miles or shorter.

The fortunate part is that I took it conservatively and it wasn&#8217;t too bad. I have a race report to come but this whole lack of training thing seemed worthy of a post of its own.

The fact is, I&#8217;m getting time on my feet, it&#8217;s just not running. This Wed I had a three hour roller derby practice, including 2 hours of scrimmage. I&#8217;ll tell ya, my legs weren&#8217;t particularly happy with that, three days after a marathon!

I also decided I want to try to get back into my old habits of at least a short run every day. So today I did 3, and I&#8217;m going to try to get in at least a mile daily. When I did this a few years ago, I made it 8 months. Let&#8217;s see how it goes this time!
