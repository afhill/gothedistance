I know rest days are important, but the second or third day in a row of working out just makes me feel so strong! Today I had a derby team meeting, then scrimmage, then a team practice (and then another meeting&#8230;). My legs felt good and strong during the scrimmage, which almost seems counter-intuitive as I&#8217;ve run the past few days. Maybe I&#8217;m just less stiff?

I did do a fair amount of stretching last night, which I do think is making a difference in my flexibility. Although I&#8217;m doing a lot of work on my legs, at least I&#8217;m mixing it up. I also got a great deep tissue massage on Friday which could have had a great impact than I&#8217;m giving it credit for. That was the first time I had to tell the masseuse to lessen up on the pressure &#8211; it was great!
