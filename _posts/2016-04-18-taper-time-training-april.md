After last week&#8217;s heavy training, I took it quite a bit easier this week. 

Monday: off!  
Tuesday: easy 6 miles. Like, REALLY easy. I went to Boulder for work so I got to enjoy the ole trails in south Boulder. Geez, I want to move back! It was very peaceful, except for when I came across a huge herd of cattle (with their babies) and had to walk through them. I was seriously concerned I&#8217;d be trampled!  
Wed: [Insanity Cardio Abs](http://club.teambeachbody.com/video/INS03633B04?Cardio+Abs&program=insanity&content_type=group-member)  
Thurs: ran an easy loop around Wash Park in the morning with Sara, then went met the Rev Running group for a [great workout Thurs night](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2016/04/still-got-my-speed/) (around 8 miles total this day)  
Fri: my knee was bugging me so I did around 2.5 easy and then did some stretches and hip work. Did a ton of rolling with the foam roller and the roll recovery. I NEED TO DO THIS MORE. Then I did the [P90X Ab Ripper](http://club.teambeachbody.com/video/P9X10942B13?Ab+Ripper+X&program=p90x&content_type=group-member) video.  
Sat: there was a winter storm warning in Denver so I wasnt super jazzed about trying to do 16 miles (with some at race pace) outdoors. Instead, I queued up the [Insanity Plyometrics Cardio Circuit](http://club.teambeachbody.com/video/INS03618B02?Plyometrics+Cardio+Circuit&program=insanity&content_type=group-member). This thing is insane, for real!  
Sun: tried to head outside for 16, but the snow was a bit deterrent. I tried to hit up the park and initially it was fun and then it just was ridiculous. So I &#8220;ran&#8221; 3 and then came home and hit up the hot tub. Recovery is important, right???

So, I guess my taper has started??
