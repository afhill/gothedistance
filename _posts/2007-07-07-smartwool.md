For those who don&#8217;t know, I am very particular about my socks. I first started wearing smartwool back in 2000 after getting some for a [product review](http://web.archive.org/web/20001216070000/www.jaggedmag.com/travel_smartwool.html) and they&#8217;ve always been my favourite for running. Somehow my supply has dwindled, but I just went and treated myself to six new pairs at [The Sock Company](http://www.sockcompany.com/smartwoolsocks.html) (my favorite online discount smartwool distributor, although I didn&#8217;t find any treasures in the discontinued area). 

Is it sad I&#8217;m excited about socks????
