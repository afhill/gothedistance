For those unaware, orthorexia is an eating disorder where the person is preoccupied with avoiding foods perceived to be unhealthy. Whereas anorexia or bulimia are related to quantity, orthorexia often involves restricting food relative to its perceived quality. 

I know plenty of people following diets or eating plans, but where&#8217;s that line of what&#8217;s a healthy approach, and what&#8217;s over the top? 

I&#8217;m acutely aware that my diet is highly restrictive. But I view it as a choice and not a requirement. I say I&#8217;m about 95% vegan and gluten-free &#8211; those are my preferences and the way I feel best eating, but I don&#8217;t view myself as a failure if I deviate. For me, that&#8217;s what makes me hopefully not too high maintenance for the people I hang out with, and it just helps me reaffirm that I&#8217;m not dancing that fine line of food obsession. 

It gives me the freedom to make decisions to eat things that&#8217;re less than ideal if I want. Like yesterday. And then, I get to deal with the repercussions today. Oh, gluten. You evil, evil thing. Days like today I wonder why I DO let myself have that tiny window of deviation. 

&#8230;.  
A dear friend came into town last night so we went out for tapas at [The Med](http://www.themedboulder.com/pdf/MedTapasMenu.pdf). I decided it was a special occasion, so I wasn&#8217;t going to limit myself only to the gluten-free items on the menu. Which is dumb, since they HAVE a lot of gluten-free items on the menu. 

I wasn&#8217;t even home yet and a light fogginess had entered my head (I only had one margarita, but it was weak and this feeling wasn&#8217;t alcohol-related). Before I went to bed, the head- and neck-ache had started: always the right side. When I&#8217;m not feeling well, my body temperature rises a bit and I feel a bit queasy: sometimes this leads to vomiting if I get too warm. Thankfully this wasn&#8217;t one of those days! I had really vivid dreams, and despite waking up a few times I slept for nearly 9 hours (I&#8217;m usually a 6hr girl with no alarm). When I would wake up, I felt disoriented (and my head and neck were painful) and my body would pull me back into sleep. 

Finally I got up to take some advil and try to get some fluid in me: sometimes my headaches can be helped with some water. I tried to start my [daily morning pages](http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/) and although generally the three to four pages just flow out of me, I had to stop several times before I was even through a half-page. 

My roommates asked if I wanted to go to the Farmer&#8217;s Market with them, but I honestly couldn&#8217;t fathom trying to crutch around in the hot sun. Heck, I was even overwhelmed with a moment of &#8220;I should go back to bed&#8230; except that would mean standing up and moving, I&#8217;m too tired&#8221;. 

I finally got out the foam roller and tried to roll out my neck. Yes, the muscles in the back of my neck get so tight I can actually roll them out. My sinuses were also bugging me so I neti-potted and slowly I started to feel like myself again. But really &#8211; for a few pieces of crostini? Not worth it! 

&#8230;.

Obviously (I hope it&#8217;s obvious) I&#8217;m being facetious when I say orthorexia makes sense. I don&#8217;t think ANY sort of addiction or obsession is healthy. But when it comes between sticking with eating foods that make you feel good, and not caring and then seeing how your body is struggling to deal with what you ingested, I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;m going to risk seeming a little more high maintenance.
