Saturday I met up with my fellow Wild Runners (Team Run Wild) at B-Dubs. Seems like a good group of people. We sat and just got to know each other. I enjoyed chatting with the organizer about some future endeavours he&#8217;s working on.. 

I&#8217;ll say it right now: I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m the weakest on the team. There are a lot of pretty darned good PRs there. But I know that&#8217;ll be a good motivator for me! I was talking to the girl next to me, she was asking about running ultras. I said that sometimes people felt they slowed down once they went up to that distance. She said &#8220;well I&#8217;m not fast now, so I don&#8217;t have much to lose&#8221;. Awhile later we were talking about Boston, and she mentioned her 3:15 qualifying time.. uh, I&#8217;d like to be &#8220;not that fast&#8221;! But I think I&#8217;ve already established myself as the crazy racer, however.. we all need our place ðŸ˜‰

So we will have nicknames on our shirts, and I&#8217;m trying in vain to come up with something. I asked my current running group, but so far nothing has really struck me. We&#8217;ll see&#8230;

This weekend is the Crown King Scramble. I&#8217;m nervous!!!! I&#8217;ve only done 20mpw the last two weeks, not because of injury, just .. priorities shifting. I do think that being at an event will get me motivated again &#8211; hard to believe Boston is just around the corner! I picked up a new digital camera the other day and will bring that with me this weekend, plus I got a paid account again on LJ so I can make an audio post en route. I figure I&#8217;ll have plenty of time!! I did look at a weather forecast and it was showers, high of 44. I sure hope not, that would be rather miserable. But I guess it&#8217;s an experience, right??

Yes, Boston is coming up steadily. I had mentioned to Meredith awhile back that since Boston was on Easter, I was considering wearing bunny ears. Well, she got some for me, so now I guess I&#8217;m committed! I keep making jokes about carrying an easter basket, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll go that far.. Helen, her Dad and I are flying into Providence to save some $$. Jude offered to pick us up, which was really nice (\*note to self, follow up with her on that\*). Sunday afternoon a few of us are gonig to the Blue Man Group show. I wanted to go in NYC and didn&#8217;t, and I thought it would be a good way to stay off our feet. Bob bowed out due to injury, which is too bad. It would have been nice to see him and Cindy and Mike, although I imagine our time will be busy as is.

So that&#8217;s the update, things are good. I have a runnersworld and a marathon and beyond waiting for me to read on the plane, and I know I&#8217;ll be much more motivated quickly. The weather is turning nice, hurrah!!
