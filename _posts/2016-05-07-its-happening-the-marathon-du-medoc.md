The NYCM and the Marathon du Medoc have been on my race bucket list for years. I finally did NYCM in 2014, and this September I&#8217;ll check off what&#8217;s known as &#8220;the longest marathon in the world&#8221; &#8211; the Marathon du Medoc.

> Fun is everywhere :  
> &#8211; The day of the Marathon, with the show before the departure, the events during the race with over 90% of runners in costume, some 52 other events alongside the race, 22 refreshment stands, 21 food stands and special gourmet stands (oysters, ham, steak, cheese, ice cream, Medoc attic, etc.) and the presence of hundreds of disguised and delighted school children.  
> &#8211; Fun in the evening after the marathon with a huge ball open to all, a fireworks display and a Marathon village vibrating to the sound of numerous bands and full of appetizing restaurants.  
> &#8211; Fun the day after the Marathon with the famous recovery walk and wine tasting open to 4,000 walkers, runners, companions and volunteers through the Margaux wine region.
