> &#8211; Hippocrates

Before my mosaicplasty knee surgery, I was advised to take Percocet every 4 hours, around the clock. I was also prescribed an anti-nausea medication. Everything I&#8217;d read online and heard from others warned me that the Percocet would make me groggy and constipated.

Less than 48 hours post-surgery, I&#8217;m feeling great, mentally and physically. I actually had to call the doctor&#8217;s office because the swelling on my leg has gone so far down my brace no longer fits.

I have no doubt that diet plays a role.

I got out of surgery around 4pm on Wednesday, and the nurse gave me some applesauce and apple juice immediately afterwards. Not my ideal first-food-in-20-hours, but it was better than the cracker option they offered up.

Two hours later, I enjoyed a green smoothie from the Vitamix: spinach, peas, banana, carrots, red and yellow peppers, apple, super greens powder and vega berry protein powder. An hour or so later I had some miso soup from Tokyo Joes: miso soup is &#8220;traditional Japanese soup that is revered for its nutritional value and its many health benefits. It is believed that miso soup detoxifies the body, prevents certain cancers, increases mental focus and improves digestive and heart health. Usually made from miso, vegetables and tofu, miso soup contains protein, trace minerals and a variety of other nutrients.&#8221; Surprised that my stomach felt fine, I also had some vegetables and brown rice as well. &#8230;And some homemade raw frozen raspberry cheesecake..

I had my alarm set to take the Percocet every four hours (at 4, 8, 12), and the doctors had warned me not to take the Percocet on an empty stomach, so I had some rice crisps when midnight rolled around.

I slept great!

The next morning I had another green smoothie with many of the same ingredients: spinach, banana, red and yellow peppers, carrots, mega greens and vega berry protein. I&#8217;m not much of a coffee drinker, but I love the Bhakti Chai Coffee blend, so I had a bottle of that as well. Around noon I had another smoothie, and felt so alert and strong we went for a drive and ran some errands (Apparently using crutches is like riding a bike: I quickly remembered how to navigate around). Out for lunch I had hummus and falafel (with cucumber and tomato) in a lettuce wrap.

I&#8217;d knew that constipation was a common problem post-surgery so I&#8217;d set myself a goal to have a bowel movement the day after surgery. Once we got home from our running around and I was able to take off the heavy brace that weighs my leg down when I try to sit on the toilet, I was able to go to the restroom relatively easily. I took this as a great sign that I was recovering quickly. Later in the evening I had some more rice and veggies.

I wore my brace most of the time, but when I did take it off for a few hours, I&#8217;d have to retighten the straps; my swelling was going down so quickly the brace was no longer snug on my leg! I have tightened each of the four clasps at least an inch each since coming home from the hospital less than 2 days ago and the doctor&#8217;s office has advised me to cut the straps so I can make it fit.

This morning&#8217;s green smoothie included blueberries, strawberries and cocoa powder as well as the spinach, banana and peppers. I did start back on my [TianChi adaptogenic herbs](http://tianchirealenergy.com/) for the first time in a week (I stopped after my pre-op when I realized I hadn&#8217;t listed it on my list of supplements and I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was ok or not). For lunch I had a big spinach salad with radishes, beets, portobella mushrooms and avocado, as well as some [Kimchi](http://grainsandmore.com/2013/04/amazing-health-benefits-of-kimchi/#sthash.KbmREOSQ.dpbs). &#8220;Due to the fermentation process kimchi is an excellent source of probiotics, these are the good bacteria that help your body fight off various infections. Kimchi is also packed with vitamins and minerals such as vitamin A, some B vitamins, iron, calcium, and selenium. These all contribute to supporting muscle growth, improve your immune system, and improve blood flow.&#8221;

Often people may decide to cut back on narcotics like Percocet because of the side effects: they feel groggy or bloated. I certainly haven&#8217;t struggled with any of these drawbacks, but I still decided to cut back from taking it every 4 hrs to every 6, just because I am feeling so good. Despite the fact I&#8217;m pretty light (117lbs), I haven&#8217;t felt knocked out by the surgery nor the painkillers, and I feel it&#8217;s because of my food-based approach to recovery. Give my body what it needs to heal, and stay away from inflammatory foods that could further compromise my system.

I didn&#8217;t explicitly seek out [Dr. Weil&#8217;s Anti-inflammatory Food Pyramid](http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02995/Dr-Weil-Anti-Inflammatory-Food-Pyramid.html) as I considered what to eat post-surgery, because I actually follow a pretty healthy diet most of the time: I am about 95% vegan and gluten-free.

When I was looking up information on mosaicplasty or knee surgery in general, I came across quite a few blog posts of people&#8217;s struggles, and wanted to share what I did to help speed recovery. I&#8217;m quite conscious of using good fuel in my body, but others may not be aware of the little things you can do to help you on your way (hint: if you&#8217;re worried about constipation, go with veggies, not grilled cheese sandwiches for recovery food!). I purposely sought out healing foods like Miso soup and kimchi, and I heartily believe some simple steps like eating the right foods can help others recover better and faster as well.
