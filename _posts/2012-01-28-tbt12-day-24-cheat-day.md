Busy day today! Met my training group at 7:30. Afterwards my coach and a few others were running in a XC race, so I stayed and watched. Then I headed to AllSports Recovery club, and finally the gym before making it back home. A quick shower, and it was time to hit up Renegade brewery for their [beer and pretzel pairing](http://www.fermentedlychallenged.com/2012/01/beer-and-pretzels-perfect-match-at.html). Yum! Lastly I decided to stop by Menchie&#8217;s and try out the mud pie yogurt they&#8217;ve been advertising. Cheat day success!
