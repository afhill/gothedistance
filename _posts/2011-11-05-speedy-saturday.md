Today I met up with the Running Republic of Boulder again. Google maps estimated 53 minutes to the starting point so I left the apartment at 6:30am :-(( turns out the directions were pretty INdirect, and I was there in plenty of time. 

We had another good workout on tap. Warmup, stretch, strides and then 12 minutes at HMP. I started out all right but as the time went on more and more folks passed me :-/ Then the group split: some did a cross-country workout while the rest of us ran the roads. My group was lead by [Colleen de Reuck](http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/biographies/letter=0/athcode=71157/index.html). We did 4x(5min, 2min RI), then 4x(30 sec, 1min RI). I actually felt a long stronger by the last 5 minute rep, and I killed the 30 sec sprints. By &#8220;killed&#8221;, I mean I was the fastest girl, and only one guy was faster than me. As I cruised by some guy (who&#8217;d been faster than me all the rest of the day), he said &#8220;nice wheels!&#8221; Then once we finished he said he should have expected my speed given my quads, and said I had &#8220;nice fast twitch muscles&#8221;. Wow.. so, that&#8217;s not anything I would have ever expected anyone to say to me, a great testament to the work I&#8217;ve done this year. I&#8217;ve always claimed I HAD no fast twitch muscle fibers!

I didn&#8217;t think to get the right splits for the 12 min, but here&#8217;s the others  
1-5:00: 7:15mm  
2-5:00: 7:09mm (a bit of downhill)  
3-5:00: 7:27mm (climbing back up the hill)  
4-5:00: 6:29mm

1-30: 5:50mm  
2-30: 5:28mm  
3-30: 4:53mm (nice downhill)  
4-30: 4:22mm (another downhill &#8211; not as aggressive as the 3rd, but I was just ready to FLY)

Then we headed back to meet up with the group, and headed back to the cars. 

Total: 10:06miles &#8211; overall 8:08pace  
Average hr 164, max 183. 

I&#8217;m surprised by the heart rate. I&#8217;m not getting near my max, maybe because we&#8217;re doing our fastest work at the end of the workout so my legs are a bit of limiting factor? But I sure can&#8217;t tell by the paces!

It was nice to chat with people, I really like the group. I love pushing myself, even if sometimes I feel like I&#8217;m totally sucking wind. It&#8217;s a great challenge.
