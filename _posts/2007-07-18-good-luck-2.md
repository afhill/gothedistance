Day three of training, and Mike was already trying to get me to sabotage it! Ha, I met Mike, Meredith and Dave at 5 for our midweek run. Dave did 5, and Meredith and Mike planned on 8 (their Columbus training doesn&#8217;t start for another couple weeks). I had nine on my schedule, but I planned to just tack on the last mile on the track. When I finished the eight, h asked if I REALLY wanted to keep running

It was icky and hot, but we did it. We actually finished in an 8:56 pace, enough that all of us complained we were going too fast, but yet we never really slowed. I finished my last mile at an 8:29 pace, so I ended up with 8:53 overall. I have to check, but I think that&#8217;s a little fast for a &#8216;general aerobic&#8217; run! ðŸ™‚ 

My heart rate ranged from 145avg for the first mile to 183avg for the last, with an overall average of 169bpm.

At home after the run, I have the yucky &#8220;can&#8217;t sweat&#8221; feeling I get on occasion. Where I just feel headachy and hot. Yuck. I guess we ARE full-swing in summer. I&#8217;m sure it will pass..
