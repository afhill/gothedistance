Breakfast is definitely the most challenging meal since going vegan/gluten-free. Look at your next morning meal and imagine it without bread, cereal, dairy, or eggs!* But fortunately working from home I have some extra time in the mornings to make something hardy and actually sit down to it. 

This morning I had a great lazy Sunday morning. I did the Ragnar Colorado relay Fri/Sat so I gave myself permission to sleep in and not run. Although I was tempted to go out for a nice big breakfast, I just turned to the fridge to see what I had. After a quick google search for inspiration, I came up with a scramble of shittake mushrooms, spinach and quinoa, with black beans and avocado on the side.

I used olive oil and a touch of sunflower butter. I thought the sunflower butter could give it a richness that could be lacking without butter or dairy, but I think it was unnecessary. I put a bit of nutritional yeast, fennel, maca and cardamom on the mushrooms and quinoa, and some lime juice on the spinach. The fennel (which has a licorice flavor, if you&#8217;re not familiar) lightened up the dish. 

The more I cook, the more attuned I&#8217;m becoming to what a dish may be lacking, flavor wise. It fun to smell something on the stove and have an idea of what could be added to it. While I&#8217;m still not a Greg cook by any means, it&#8217;s fun to play around and be creative in the kitchen!

*Note: case in point, my roommate just invited me to dim sum. Pretty sure there is NOTHING there I could eat. But, this was delicious itself&#8230;
