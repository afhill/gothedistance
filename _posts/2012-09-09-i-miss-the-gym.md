Friday I had the day off work bc of the Ragnar Colorado Relay, but our team wasn&#8217;t starting til the afternoon so I headed to the gym in the morning. Its been awhile since I went regularly and I miss it! I worked on my bench press and hit a new max rep off 115! Then I did a bunch of other upper body work, and a short crossfit-like workout of 5 min AMRAP 15 box jumps, 10 burpees, 5 ezbar bicep curls. I like the feeling of pushing yourself and realizing gains; I&#8217;m not seeing that as much during running anymore.

Frankly, I&#8217;m not sure running 6x/week and not doing anything else is the best for me. I feel a bit burnt out mentally and physically. I like developing my strength in different ways. Obviously I may change my tune after my fall races, but as of now I&#8217;m considering dropping my mileage and going back to incorporating more strength training into my regimen.
