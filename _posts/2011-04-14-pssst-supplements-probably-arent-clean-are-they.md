Queen unearthed this article on the [prevalent use of supplements by Americans](http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/04/13/supplements.dietary/index.html) and of course, I have thoughts on the matter. 

I&#8217;m actually quite a pill-popper, myself. But guess what, all that list of random stuff-in-a-gelatin*-capsule probably doesn&#8217;t jive with eating clean. 

I recently read &#8220;In Defense of Food&#8221; and liked the sentiment expressed therein. The notion wasn&#8217;t necessarily to TAKE supplements, but to be the type of person who takes supplements. It turns out it&#8217;s a bit difficult to assess the effectiveness of various supplements because those of us who take them are also generally doing other healthy things in addition. 

This article as well as &#8220;In Defense of Food&#8221; both bring up the concern that we don&#8217;t definitively know what in whole foods gives us the benefits, or if it&#8217;s the combination of the nutrients therein. 

> &#8220;I will always say the reason to eat fruits and vegetables &#8212; it&#8217;s not vitamin C, it&#8217;s because of the colors, it&#8217;s the words you can&#8217;t pronounce,&#8221; she said, referring to nutrients like lycopene, quercetin or indoles. &#8220;That&#8217;s the reason you eat fruits and vegetables. To just throw vitamin C at it, it doesn&#8217;t do nutrition justice.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve also been really interested to learn about the complement and conflict between different elements. I used to take all my vitamins in the morning, before learning that you shouldn&#8217;t take Iron and Calcium at the same time, some need to be taken with food, some not. It&#8217;s actually neat to think of the delicate balance of all the pieces, but again: this is getting down to this extracted, processed&#8230; stuff, isn&#8217;t it? Not simply food?

The more I read about nutrition, the more I realize I know sooo little. So I pop some pretty capsules and assume I&#8217;m doing good for myself..

By the way, did you know Consumer Reports has a whole [&#8220;Natural health&#8221; section](http://www.consumerreports.org/health/natural-health/index.htm)?

*the last two supplements I purchased, CLA and a multi-, are vegan, so no gelatin capsule.
