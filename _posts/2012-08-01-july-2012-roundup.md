This marked my third highest mileage month of the year, at 198. Pretty impressive given the fact I completed the [Leadville Marathon](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/07/leadville-trail-marathon-race-report/) on June 30th. I didn&#8217;t rest completely afterwards, but I let my mileage build up over the course of the month to where I want it to be.

Total miles: 198  
Days run: 24/31

Events this month included the [Superior Downhill Mile](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/07/the-superior-downhill-mile-race-report/), the [Four on the Fourth 4K](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/07/four-on-the-fourth-4k-race-report/) and the Epic Relay (which I still owe a race report for!)

Racing twice the week after the Leadville Marathon may have seemed to indicate I was recovered well, but I think it did cause a bit of a setback. This has been a tough month for me, training-wise. Granted it&#8217;s been hot, but I&#8217;ve felt that it&#8217;s been tough to get my turnover, and I&#8217;m just tired during workouts. I&#8217;ve been going to AllSports and trying to fuel properly and I&#8217;m hoping things will turn around. If not, I&#8217;m not adverse to taking the time I need to recover and be able to hit my key workouts hard. I did say to my coach, and want it recorded here, that I accept that running a marathon DOES impact your overall speed afterwards. Although I&#8217;d like to, I will not run the Pikes Peak Marathon this year as I really want to do well in Columbus. 

I&#8217;ve started fitting in a few more two-a-days and still taking a day a week off, and I&#8217;ve finally reached an overall weekly average of 40mpw for the year (taking a complete week off after the Houston marathon really affected the average early in the year!)
