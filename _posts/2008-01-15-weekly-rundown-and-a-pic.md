This whole &#8220;running every day&#8221; thing is actually turning out pretty well &#8212; it&#8217;s easy to tell myself &#8220;it&#8217;s only a mile, just do it&#8221; and then invariably I head outside and feel great. Also, not being in a formal training period has given me some flexibility. I&#8217;m mixing up the runs, which has helped keep it interesting. For example:

Last Sunday: 1.5miles around the neighbourhood (avg: 9:09 pace)  
Monday: started out running in the neighbourhood, after 2 miles decided to use my HRM to make it a recovery run. total=6mi  
Tuesday: LT workout! 1mi warmup (8:51pace), 2miles at 7:34pace, 1mi cooldown (9:03 pace)  
Wednesday: 2.25 around the neighbourhood (avg: 9:20 pace)  
Thursday: 2.5 with a friend who&#8217;s training for her first half.. essentially a recovery run (11:06pace)  
Friday: 1mi on the treadmill  
Saturday: 1 loop at Highbanks (we call it 6, really, it&#8217;s only 5.56 &#8212; 9:08pace), 4mile race (7:14pace)  
Sunday: 2 with my &#8220;training buddy&#8221; &#8211; 10:53pace  
Monday: 1mi on the treadmill &#8212; &#8220;random&#8221; workout at 7:30 pace, then a toning class at the gym  
Today: started out running in the neighbourhood, after 1.35 decided to make it a recovery run. total=5.75mi

The Columbus Running Company had their intern out taking photos of the race last weekend, this turned out decent!<br clear="all" />
