Since learning of my gluten sensitivity, I&#8217;ve tried to be careful about avoiding wheat. I read [Defeat Wheat](http://www.defeatwheat.com/) on my trip last week, and another passenger on the plane suggested I read &#8220;Wheat Belly&#8217; as well (I flipped through her copy on her iPad, but haven&#8217;t yet read it). 

Some of the side effects I&#8217;ve heard of from consuming gluten with an intolerance include bloating and having a fuzzy head. Yesterday I had a few gluten-free beers and felt fine today &#8211; for the past few years, a single beer would leave me in rough shape the next day. Perhaps it was the gluten and not the alcohol?

Then today I inadvertently put things to the test. After about a week of gluten-free living, I ate an Amy&#8217;s vegetable pizza. I thought I&#8217;d grabbed the rice crust one the last time I was at the store but it was already in the oven before I realized my mistake. Oh well&#8230;

Except, it was a great way for me to realize that right after eating, I felt a heaviness in my belly I haven&#8217;t experienced in awhile. I realized how I used to just accept this uncomfortable heaviness, but since cutting out gluten, I haven&#8217;t felt this way. 

I&#8217;ve told myself and others that I didn&#8217;t think my sensitivity was very strong, as I&#8217;d heard stories of those with Celiac&#8217;s disease becoming incredibly ill from the tiniest exposure to gluten. But as I sit here hours after dinner still feeling like there is a weight in my abdomen, I realize that I have an option, I don&#8217;t have to feel this way. This gross heavy feeling isn&#8217;t normal.

It&#8217;s exciting, actually. If I consider how I feel now, how I can sense my body working hard to process that wheat, I&#8217;m eager to see what more my body can expend energy on if I give it good clean fuel it can process well. Not just physically (which was my first thought), but also mentally. How much am I focusing on the churning in my tummy when I could be thinking of other things besides relief? 

I bought some gluten-free bagels and bread today, although I think I want to do my best to incorporate other whole foods rather than just still having alternative breads and pasta. I made some beet and hemp granola this morning, and have been enjoying quinoa for breakfast as well. I&#8217;ve never really been a huge sandwich eater and it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve made pasta of any kind at home. I want to focus more on increasing my protein intake than just substituting carbs..
