When I go out to restaurants, I often choose lentils if they&#8217;re available. Yet I&#8217;m never quite sure what to do with them at home. Tonight was an attempt to figure something out&#8230;

The recipe is officially &#8220;Rosemary Lentils over Polenta&#8221; but it called for instant polenta, which I didn&#8217;t have on hand. I did end up trying to make some [coconut cornbread](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2013/04/coconut-cornbread/ "Coconut Cornbread") but my timing was off so I was finished with the lentils before the cornbread was ready.

Every recipe I see (and everyone I know who cooks with lentils) refers to dried lentils, but I have several cans of lentils in my pantry, so I went ahead and used them today. AND I didn&#8217;t have parsley so I used cilantro. Other than that, though, I followed the recipe to a T! ðŸ™‚ 

&#8211; Saute onion and garlic  
&#8211; add 2 cups of vegetable broth, 1 cup of lentils, 2 cups of water, 1tsp dried rosemary, 2 small bay leaves.  
&#8211; bring to boil, then reduce heat. (the directions called for adjusting the temperature while the lentils were softened, which I didn&#8217;t really have to worry about).  
&#8211; Add 1/4 cup cilantro  
&#8211; Remove from heat

Pretty simple! The rosemary smelled delicious, but I found overall it didn&#8217;t have much flavor. I don&#8217;t know if it was because of the cilantro or the canned lentils. I added some spices and it wasn&#8217;t bad, although it certainly wasn&#8217;t anything outstanding. 

Hmm, I feel like most of my recipes end with that sort of a non-recommendation.. I suppose I should cut myself some slack, shouldn&#8217;t I??
