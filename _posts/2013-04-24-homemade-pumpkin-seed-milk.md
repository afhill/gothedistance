It&#8217;s official, I am the proud owner of a [Vitamix](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?SKU=202349) ! So expect some non-solid recipes while I try out my new toy&#8230;

I&#8217;ve long been a fan of juices and smoothies, but my old blender wasn&#8217;t the best at grinding up solid food (I think I burned out the motor on my Cuisinart with the first week!) One of the benefits to a blender this powerful is that you can make alternative (nut) milks. I decided to look up some recipes and came across something even more alternative &#8211; [pumpkin seed milk!](http://healthyblenderrecipes.com/recipes/homemade_raw_pumpkin_seed_milk/) It just so happens that pumpkin seeds are on sale at Whole Foods so I had a ton of them, so it seemed a good experiment.

It was SO SIMPLE! 

Ingredients:  
&#8211; 3 soaked and pitted dates  
&#8211; 1 cup pumpkin seeds  
&#8211; 3 cups filtered water  
&#8211; 1 Tbsp coconut oil  
&#8211; cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg

Throw everything in the blender and turn it on! 

It was super easy to make, and pretty tasty. I really liked the spices I put in, and I bet if I&#8217;d put some cashews in, it would have been even thicker and like a pumpkin pie milkshake. 

I suspect my days of buying almond milk are numbered. This was so quick and easy, and there aren&#8217;t a bunch of additives. Yum!
