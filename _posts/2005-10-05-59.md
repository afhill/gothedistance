they say that irritability is a potential sign of overtraining. I may need to watch out.

I&#8217;m so frustrated at things lately. Sure, it could have something to do with the fact that I work 40 hrs, drive 10 hrs, go to school 8 hrs and train 5-10 hrs a week. I just feel so impatient though, and I feel bad. It&#8217;s as though I know I have so much to do that I don&#8217;t want anyone holding me back.

Hopefully things will smooth over soon.
