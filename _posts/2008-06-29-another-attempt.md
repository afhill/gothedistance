I&#8217;ve mentioned before that my Mom is considering running a full marathon to celebrate her 60th birthday in 2009. She was speaking with some of her running friends about it, and someone mentioned that if they could only run one marathon, it would definitely be&#8230; NYC. My Mom trains out of the [Running Room](http://runningroom.com/hm/), and they offer guaranteed entry and hotel and flight packages. I think she&#8217;s seriously considering it.  
Which of course leaves me with a dilemma. How do I manage to run the same race as her? I suppose I could also look into the guaranteed entry packages, although the price is absolutely horrendous. Or I could refocus my efforts (yes, again) on qualifying. 

I feel that I&#8217;m doing well this year, and if [Meredith](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/)&#8216;s coach ever lets her run with the gang again, I can only assume I&#8217;ll benefit from the residual effects of her enhanced performance. I suppose it&#8217;s a goal, right? And we all know I need goals to stay on track&#8230;
