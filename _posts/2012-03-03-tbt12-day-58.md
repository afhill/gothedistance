Got up early bc I wanted one final trip to the gym before my flight. I ate a TON, so much for being careful about not going to the weigh-in any heavier than I needed to. But glancing back at yesterday, doesn&#8217;t seem like I ate much so that&#8217;s probably why I devoured my food. Ate out a lot bc of traveling but my choices were decent. It was tough not to eat the French fries at Red Robin!

#### Food

Smoothie: coconut milk, egg whites, blueberries, banana, hemp seed,  
Tea  
Whole wheat bagel thin with egg whites, mushroom, asparagus from Einstein bagels  
Peanuts, almonds, raisins  
Chipotle burrito bowl (brown rice, black beans, salsa, peppers, onions, guacamole, lettuce)  
Veggie burger with guac and a fried egg on whole wheat from Red Robin. For some reason the garden burger/fried egg combo reminded me of a filet-o-fish from McDonald&#8217;s, not sure if it was the flakiness or the friedness ðŸ™‚

#### Exercise

Bench press- my rotator cuff felt meh on the way to the gym. Did 5x(5x80lbs), 10x75lbs, 7x75lbs, 15x65lbs. Nervous about my ability to do 30x80lbs tomorrow. I need some mental strength!  
Also a few pushups and abs. 

It was fun arriving in Columbus, my friends Helen and Andrew had already been to the Arnold. Andrew is a total meathead so he was telling me about all the people they saw at the Expo. He was encouraging about my bench so we&#8217;ll see how it goes. The forecast for Sunday is getting increasingly colder, which doesn&#8217;t excite me.  
We stopped at Frontrunner for our race packets and I picked up some calf sleeves (couldn&#8217;t find mine at home) but my calf is feeling good.  
Then we watched &#8220;Pumping Iron&#8221;. It was a fun change from running movies. Hopefully it&#8217;ll inspire me for Sunday! Helen thinks I&#8217;ll get even more into lifting after this.
