Why will your legs hate you, Andrea? Did you do some interval training running? Do a lower body workout? Go to derby practice?  
Yes.

I woke up at 3:30, which was just slightly too early to start the day&#8217;s workout, so went back to bed and slept til almost 7. Now that I&#8217;m in the habit of waking early (I was up by 6:30 on the weekend even without an alarm), this &#8220;sleeping in&#8221; feels great! 

I just picked up some [creatine](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/koch1.htm), I&#8217;ve been thinking about it for awhile. The instructions say to drink it with a sweetened beverage. Uhm&#8230; sweetened beverage? Who drinks those! I actually had a bit of a bolthouse green goodness smoothie in the fridge, but I will actually have to buy something to take this supplement with, which is a bit of a pain. 

Based on some reading you should cycle creatine to see gains. I used the little calculator based on my weight, and came up with:  
Week 1: 18 Grams Per Day.  
Week 2 &#8211; 4: 8 Grams Per Day.  
Week 5: OFF &#8211; No Creatine Use.  
Week 6: 18 Grams Per Day.  
Week 7: 8 Grams Per Day.  
Week 8 &#8211; 10: OFF &#8211; No Creatine Use. 

I was thinking I&#8217;d wait to start using it until I was going to do some heavy lifting, but then I had a crazy workout day today and changed my mind ðŸ™‚

As part of my coffee break, I ducked into Barnes and Nobles to use my groupon. As it turns out, it &#8216;expired&#8217; on April 10th, but then they just dropped the value down to $10 (the original sale price). I was impressed that&#8217;s how they handled it, so you didn&#8217;t really lose your money. I was amused by the endcap.. look what&#8217;s mainstream!

I purchased &#8220;[Vegan with a Vengeance](http://www.theppk.com/books/vegan-with-a-vengeance/), AND earlier today I emailed Vicki at [VeganCooks.com](http://www.vegancooks.com) about signing up for a class on Asian Noodles/Middle Eastern Grains in a few weeks. While I&#8217;m not sure I could go completely down the vegan path, I&#8217;d like to be more versed in plant-based options. 

When I did some detoxing a few years ago, they had me drink 4oz of water every half hour (at least). Since Creatine can dehydrate you, I decided to get back in the habit. So I set my alarm for 30 min and take a few sips every time it goes off (4oz isn&#8217;t much). It&#8217;s a good habit to get into, methinks!

After work, I headed to the rec center to get in some interval training. My goal was: 1 mile warmup, 10x(400m @ 1:40 with a 400m RI), 1 mile cooldown. The Run Less, Run Faster schedule for a 3:20 marathon has the intervals at 1:30, but I didn&#8217;t think that was remotely feasible. As it is, 1:40 is still a 6:40 mile, which I think is pretty satisfactory, especially as I&#8217;m just getting back into running. As it turns out, it was a little soft!  
1-1:38  
2-1:38  
3-1:38  
4-1:39  
5-1:38  
6-1:38  
7-1:36  
8-1:34  
9-1:34  
10-1:31

With my warmup and cooldown, all in all I ran 6.9miles in 55:33, which is an overall 8:03 pace (and my times above were around to a 6:32 pace!)  
I finished my run with time to spare before derby practice, so&#8230; I decided to get my lower body workout in as well. Can you say, glutton for punishment??

And THEN I jumped in my car and headed to derby practice! It was a Bruising team practice, as we&#8217;re getting ready for a bout on Saturday, so I jammed a lot! But, the ole legs served me well and I actually felt stronger as the night went on. The one difficulty was that I downed some creatine (in water) en route to practice, which gave me a horrible sore scratchy throat. Yuck! When I told Scott I took creatine, he even said he hoped I&#8217;d taken it with something sweet because otherwise it was like salt water. I&#8217;m not sure it was quite like that, but it was rough! (But hey, handicaps during practice make you stronger, right??)

So all in all..

#### Food

  * Kashi GoLean Cereal &#8211; my parents left this with me when they visited. I scrutinized the label. It has brown rice syrup and honey as sweeteners so theoretically it seems clean, but I wouldn&#8217;t have bought it myself. Kefir and strawberries
  * Bolthouse green goodness smoothie (I realized I have no idea if it&#8217;s goodness or goddess)
  * banana, almond butter, hemp seed in a whole wheat tortilla
  * quinoa, steamed carrots, steamed beets
  * non-fat latte. I&#8217;m a bit disappointed that I&#8217;m letting coffee sneak back into my diet, but I really think I just wanted an excuse to get out of the office today. At least I stayed away from the chai. I&#8217;ve let Starbucks slip in lately, but I will be relegating chai lattes for cheat days! Another concern I have (other than the use of stimulants) is that I&#8217;m drinking calories that aren&#8217;t necessarily bringing me a lot nutritionally. Having a coffee at 2 didn&#8217;t make me hungry for a few hours, and I&#8217;d probably be better off having a nutritional snack than drinking those calories!
  * apple with peanut butter and hemp seed
  * hummus and whole wheat pita chips
  * probar superfood slam
  * smoothie: egg whites, kefir, oatmeal, spinach, cantaloupe, banana, orange, frozen berries, chia seed, flaxseed, wheat germ, hemp protein powder, glutamine

#### Exercise

  * 6.9 mile run with 2.5 &#8220;fast&#8221; miles
  * Back Squat: 4 sets of 6-8 repetitions (smith machine: 50lbs+bar, then raised to 70lbs+bar)
  * Stiff-Legged Deadlift: 4 sets of 6-8 repetitions (70lbs+ezbar)
  * One-Legged Leg Press: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions (125lbs)
  * Hamstring Curl: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions (30lbs. I&#8217;ve never liked hamstring curls, and it was the one thing the doc told me not to do following my pcl tear. So I was nervous about this one)
  * Seated Calf Raises: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions (210lbs)
  * 2 hrs derby practice</ul> 

Oh, new factoid of the day. [Red pee after eating beets can indicate an iron deficiency](http://www.fitsugar.com/Connection-Between-Beets-Red-Urine-Iron-2036552). Don&#8217;t think too long about why I looked that up. 

Ok, off to ice and ibuprofin! I&#8217;m meeting my trainer at 6:15 in the morning, and we have a 2hr scrimmage and MHC team practice tomorrow night.
