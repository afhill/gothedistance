Work: still loving it, but it&#8217;s intense and takes a lot of brainpower  
School: has been stressing me out and taking a LOT of time and effort. Like, I spent nearly 4 hours studying at a coffee shop today and didn&#8217;t even get through one chapter for one class.  
Running: was another pressure I was putting on myself to reach a certain weekly mileage, targeting a specific pace. 

I use the past tense for running b/c I&#8217;ve decided not to run the Columbus marathon this year. I was already feeling burnt out and not confident about meeting my goal, and then I pulled my hamstring which forced me to take some time off. Which I actually really enjoyed. 

Pretty well everything I spend time on is associated with some sort of pressure on myself, and it&#8217;s just too much. I say that I love running, but lately it&#8217;s been something I&#8217;ve done out of obligation, practically something I&#8217;ve dreaded. That isn&#8217;t how it should be! So I decided to drop out of the race, and sure enough I was happy to lace up my shoes a few days last week, because I wanted to! 

I can&#8217;t take too much time off b/c Mom and I are running NYCM in less than a month! I&#8217;m sure that will help get me motivated again! I&#8217;ve also been really happy to go back to the gym and lift, and I&#8217;ve also started to go to yoga recently. Just trying out some different things to find some balance in my life.

A few people have remarked I&#8217;ve been absent from social media, some of that is purely lack of time, but I will admit some of it is because I&#8217;m still grappling with how I feel about running right now. It&#8217;ll be tough when the group goes to Columbus and I&#8217;m here at home. Sure, it&#8217;ll be good to have that time for homework, but I HAVE put a lot of miles in this year and I hope I don&#8217;t regret not seeing what they would amount to.. 

I just know I need to focus a bit more on my mental state: feeling more content with what I can get done in the hours a day I have available to me, and part of that means not putting myself in a situation where I may not perform to the level I&#8217;d like. I had a few weeks like that at school (although I think things are turning around), and it&#8217;s tough. I am trying to do some self-care and just cut myself some slack, but that&#8217;s definitely not something I&#8217;m really good at. But I&#8217;m trying..
