Yes, I&#8217;m actually making a smart running decision.

No Tecumseh Trail Marathon for me in December. I tried running twice this week, and my knee is really giving me trouble. I may force myself to exclusively use the elliptical next week..

This sucks b/c I&#8217;d like to run the race, even &#8220;just for fun&#8221;, but I know what&#8217;s smart.
