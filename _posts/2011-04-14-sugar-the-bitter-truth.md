I had this entertaining little video shared with me yesterday.

Ok, just kidding, it&#8217;s a college lecture with a lot of biochemistry. But even though I didn&#8217;t want to believe the evils of fructose, I made myself listen. Honestly, I wish I&#8217;d been 100% attentive to really try to understand all this stuff. 

#### Random highlights to save you 1.5hrs:

  * drinking Coke is like drinking a pizza (added salt that makes you thirstier)
  * there are reportedly no differences between HFCS and sugar. But any sugar consumption is negative. 
  * HFCS is evil, but not metabolically evil. It&#8217;s economically evil. It&#8217;s found it&#8217;s way into everything. Bread, ketchup, everything. It&#8217;s been added surreptitiously to all our processed food.
  * HFCS actually makes sense for elite athletes who are glycogen-depleted. Original Gatorade tasted bad, then Pepsi bought it and added HFCS. Now it&#8217;s not elite athletes who drink it, it&#8217;s fat kids
  * &#8220;When God made the poison, he packaged it with the antidote&#8221;. Where fructose exists in nature, there is way more fiber. Eat your carbohydrate with fiber. That&#8217;s why fruit is okay.
  * Fructose is a carbohydrate, but it&#8217;s metabolized like a fat (a low-fat diet isn&#8217;t really a low-fat diet, because fructose doubles as a fat)
  * A calorie is not a calorie, and fructose is not glucose
  * You&#8217;re not what you eat, you are what you do with what you eat
  * fructose is alcohol without the buzz (alcohol is metabolized by the brain, but then both are processed by the liver)



I have to let this roll around in my head for awhile.. I&#8217;m generally very black and white. If something is bad, it&#8217;s bad. Yet I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m willing to believe that fruits are bad b/c they have fructose. I think it&#8217;s more about that balance, as Dr. Lustig said, the poison is packaged with the antidote. I&#8217;ve cut down on juices anyway because years ago I learned that it&#8217;s the fiber in the fruit that&#8217;s good for you, not necessarily the juice itself (and I also believe that may be why on some level I like pulp in my juice).
