Tomorrow is the [Pueblo&#8217;s Rock Canyon Half Marathon](http://www.socorunners.org/races/raceinfo/RockCanyoninfo2008.htm "Pueblo's Rock Canyon Half Marathon"). This race fit in nicely with my training schedule, which stated that tomorrow could be either:

> **Fast Finish Long Run**: 14 to 18 miles total with the last 4 to 6 miles at goal marathon pace OR  
> **RACE/Time Trial**: 15 to 25 kilometers.

A few weeks ago, the idea of a race seemed like a great idea, but we now have all this white stuff on the ground, so I&#8217;m not sure how pleasant the experience will be. 

<!--more-->Currently my best half-marathon is 1:41:56, set at the 

[Dayton Air Force Half Marathon](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2006/09/dayton-air-force-half-results/ "Dayton Air Force Half Marathon") in 2006. Since my pace at that race is roughly my target for the marathon in a few weeks, I feel as though I am ripe for a PR. Obviously, there are a few factors here: I haven&#8217;t tapered and there is this crazy weird white stuff on the ground. Yet, I feel I stand a good chance. 

My training program specifically tells me to start the run at :45 to 1:00 per mile slower than goal marathon pace and focus on running fast the last few miles. We&#8217;ll see how that goes! I think the starting slow will help me ease into a pace so I can finish strong. 

My secret goal is sub 1:40, although that&#8217;s a pretty big jump and I&#8217;m not sure my training has had me to do the speedwork that requires. I will admit, even just shaving off a few seconds will make me happy.
