I was already starting to get a little excited about races for the year &#8212; Bridget mentioned that she&#8217;ll probably run the Indian Run this year since it&#8217;s not the same week as Reach the Beach. So here&#8217;s some of the races I&#8217;m thinking about&#8230;

July 14: Columbus Running Company 1 Mile Dash: http://www.columbusrunning.com/mile.htm  
September 16: State-to-State Half Marathon: http://www.statetostate.org/index.html \****  
September 22: Hocking Hills Indian Run: http://1800hocking.com/indianrun  
October 7: Steamtown Marathon: http://steamtownmarathon.com/

I know I want to do a certified half marathon in August or September.. the State to State is certified so that may be the one!

I&#8217;d like to do at least another couple 5Ks, maybe one 10K and a 5 miler. I don&#8217;t like speedwork, this will force me! ðŸ˜‰
