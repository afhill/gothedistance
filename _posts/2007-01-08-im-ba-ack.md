met the gang Saturday morning out at [Three Creeks metro park](http://www.metroparks.net/ParksThreeCreeks.aspx). It was over 50 degrees, crazy!! Meredith started to scare me the other day when she mentioned mid-April was only 14.5 weeks away, and I&#8217;d only run 4 times since Thanksgiving! The gang was planning to do about 10 miles, so I said I&#8217;d start with them and see how it went.

Our first mile was 9:15, and we threw a couple 8 min miles in there. We got to the turn around in 40 min, at which point we figured we had NOT run 5.2 miles, we&#8217;re not sure how the route ended up short. The way back was a bit shorter (we took the shorter part of a loop). Around mile 8.5 as we crossed over a bridge I started to feel dizzy, so I walked a bit. Meredith had started picking up the pace in her usual style, so it wasn&#8217;t long before I didn&#8217;t see anyone anymore. I jogged a bit, then met with Rich. Walked a few more steps with him before setting out again. Somehow, that mile still ended up being 8:18, so everyone else REALLY must have been booking it! My last mile ended up being about 9:28 or so, not great, but not too bad considering I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d run over 5 or 6 miles since Marshall!

I was sore the next day (ha! I&#8217;m still sore today), but it felt good. It reminded me of when I started training, like it was actually having an effect. 

Last night I was reading &#8220;[Road Racing for Serious Runners](http://www.amazon.com/Road-Racing-Serious-Runners-Pfitzinger/dp/0880118180) because I want to incorporate the speedwork for a half marathon into my training this time around. Targeting the [Athens half marathon](http://www.athensmarathon.org/) on April 1st, it had my long run for this upcoming week at 12 miles (perfect, we&#8217;re planning on 12 at highbanks), and a v02 Max workout of 5x 2:30 uphill. I hit the gym this morning and did just that:

5min warmup  
2:30 at 6.0 incline  
1:30 at 0:0 incline  
4x (2:30 at 7.0 incline, 1:30 at 0:0 incline)  
3:30 at 0:00 incline

which left me at 28:35, and somehow exactly 3 miles. I was going at about a 9:15/9:30mm, which worked for me. My hips feel quite tight, I definitely have some stretching to do. But my knees feel fine, which is great! 

I was telling Meredith, I think my plan will be:  
Monday: treadmill in the morning  
Tues: hopefully run with her  
Wed: off (class)  
Thurs: treadmill in the morning (?)  
Fri: run with Helen  
Sat: run with the gang  
Sun: off

I think that should give me a good mix of different environments and get myself in gear!

In other news, Paris doesn&#8217;t look to be happening this year, finances are just not accomodating. I have another super-secret plan involving the oldest annual marathon on the continent, but I don&#8217;t want to jnx that just yet either&#8230;
