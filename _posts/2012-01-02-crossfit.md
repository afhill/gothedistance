> &#8220;Andrea is so flexible she could do a stiff-legged deadlift and probably be stronger than most of the guys here.&#8221;  
> &#8211; Instructor at my first day of Crossfit

Today I went to my first Crossfit class at [Crossfit Lohi](http://www.crossfitlodo.com)! 

I&#8217;ve purchased a few crossfit packages from Daily Deal sites, but hadn&#8217;t had a chance to use them until today. The place is actually within walking distance to my apartment, which could be VERY dangerous&#8230;

They make you go through 4 basics workshops before you actually get to attend classes, which I was kinda bummed about. There was a short lecture on how &#8220;unlike working out in the 90s, you don&#8217;t focus on &#8216;chest and tris&#8217; one day, &#8216;back and biceps&#8217; the next&#8221;. Rather, crossfit workouts focus on functional strength and tapping into different energy sources. So while you may work the same body part from day to day, you&#8217;re working it for different durations (seconds, minutes, etc). That&#8217;s not really anything I&#8217;d heard about crossfit before, so it was kinda interesting. Although we all know I LIKE muscle definition, not just &#8220;functional strength&#8221;! 

Then we got to do some technique work, deadlifts and cleans. My kettlebell experience (and also working with a trainer for a short period) definitely came into play. It&#8217;s still very weird for me to hear that I&#8217;m flexible! The cleans were a little different than the kettlebell cleans I&#8217;m used to but it seemed pretty straightforward. 

I asked another instructor about the tightness in my back (left rear shoulder blade) I feel when I was doing the cleans. He asked if it was my rotator cuff. I don&#8217;t know.. that&#8217;s sorta why I was asking! He told me to squeeze my back more as I set up, and that seemed to help, and if anything made me feel like perhaps the tightness is the RIGHT thing to feel?

Then we ran out of time and didn&#8217;t get to do through the rest of the lifts for the day, so the instructor told us to do a Tabata burpee workout. But it was a weird type of burpee I&#8217;d never done before which had you actually throw yourself right down to the ground (not a pushup). I did a couple rounds and then the top of my left shoulder started hurting. Crap! So I stopped and did situps for awhile. That sucked. I did the last two rounds with the group again. 

The sore shoulder was a bummer, but apart from that it was pretty fun. There was a lot of standing around as our partners went and the instructor gave them feedback, so it wasn&#8217;t the greatest workout today. But I anticipate it&#8217;ll be fun once we actually get going!
