Chatted with Cheryl tonight and asked her about the herniated disk she has in her back (that keeps her to a max 5 miles of running a day). I asked her about how it felt, and told her about the back pain I&#8217;ve been having. Alot of our conversation, we were agreeing. Yes, the pain is on one side. No, a heating pad doesn&#8217;t help. Yes, there was a time lying on my back when I couldnt lift myself up..

This is not good. 

I did some more research tonight and there definitely seem to be a lot more serious symptoms than I&#8217;ve exhibited, but at the same time, a little warning bell has gone off. She mentioned that there are specific PT exercices to do, and I may just have to set myself at doing them now, just in case. 

I haven&#8217;t been running for that long, but I definitely consider it part of my life style&#8230;
