I literally dreamt about starbucks and chipotle last night, must be cheat day! 

I went to the gym, and then looked in my fridge:

Nothing to cheat with! I haven&#8217;t been grocery shopping since I moved, so I only have good food!  
I had a doc appointment this morning, and they had a nice spread of treats. I eyed the cookies, but in the end I decided I really didn&#8217;t need a cookie at 9am.

I did stop at Starbucks, but I decided to go for a nonfat chai latte rather than a white chocolate mocha with two pumps of hazelnut ðŸ™‚

#### Exercise

I always keep track of my exercises on my iPhone in the Notes app. This morning it was acting up, so I tried something different.. and it ate my entries! So from memory, here are the exercises I did (I&#8217;m somewhat glad it was a shorterish workout):

  * Wide grip pulldown-75lbs?
  * Butterfly- 40lbs
  * Chest press- 135lbs
  * Dumbbell shrug &#8211; 30lbs
  * Bent over ez-bar row 50lbs
  * Back extensions-25lbs
  * Unilateral lat pull-60lbs
  * abs
