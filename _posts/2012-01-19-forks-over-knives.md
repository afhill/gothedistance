I finally made the time to watch Forks Over Knives, a movie promoting a plant-based diet for health reasons. 



I was a bit concerned that the film would come off overly preachy/radical/dry. But I was actually pleasantly surprised. The &#8220;V&#8221; word (vegan) was rarely mentioned, and instead there was more talk of a &#8220;whole food, plant-based diet&#8221;. That doesn&#8217;t sound so scary, does it? 

The premise of the film is quite compelling: a few doctors (one clinical, one scholastic) who each discover the impact animal-based products have on our health. The film does a good job at sharing the research, rather than just jumping to conclusions like some &#8220;[documentaries](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386032/)&#8221; tend to do. Of course, you always wonder how many cases they didn&#8217;t share, where the transition to a plant-based diet DIDN&#8217;T dramatically improve an individual&#8217;s health. 

As a vegetarian, giving up eating meat isn&#8217;t even something to be concerned with. I will admit that eschewing dairy, or oil (something I know Dr. Esselyn promotes) is a bit of a larger leap. The film shows how sugars, processed food and oils can trick our bodies&#8217; satiety sensors, which I suppose makes sense, but I don&#8217;t fully understand how that&#8217;s so bad unless we&#8217;re gulping gallons of it? (Unless the goal is simply not to do anything that &#8220;tricks&#8221; the body at all) Apparently I have some research to do!

It wasn&#8217;t for shock value &#8220;if you ever eat meat again, you&#8217;ll die&#8221;. In fact, in one study they manipulated the amount of casein protein they gave a study group and saw the development of (&#8230; was it tumors?) ebb and flow, showing how even limiting intake had a positive effect. Moderation is better than nothing. 

All in all, it was a powerful film, one that I think is important for people to see to make their own decisions about what they put in their bodies. It&#8217;s hard for me to push my &#8216;vegetarian agenda&#8217; on people, but I think that seeing this film may be enough to prompt people to consider the costs of what they consume.
