Tonight I met A and W for a trail run. We met at Matthew Winters park to run &#8220;the hogback&#8221;. Just as I pulled up, it started pouring so we hung out in the car for awhile. It was the first time I&#8217;d met W so we talked about races: he&#8217;s done some type of the Pikes Peak weekend for over a decade now! This year he&#8217;s just doing the Ascent. 

The course itself was gorgeous: nice ups and downs with some really gorgeous views:

We ran at different paces, so there was some stopping and going as we&#8217;d gather then disperse. Overall it was a great workout and it made me even more excited for the weekend. 

I also have to say, I LOVE [DailyMile](http://www.dailymile.com) and its garmin integration:

After the run I grabbed a veggie fajita bowl at Chipotle and then headed over to Runners Roost where I wanted to try on some new shoes. Sadly, they close at 7pm so I&#8217;ll have to save that for another day. I&#8217;ve been tossing around the idea of lightweight racing shoes and I think I&#8217;ll go for it in anticipation of that [1:36:xx in October](http://runrocknroll.competitor.com/denver)!
