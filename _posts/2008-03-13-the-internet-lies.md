I let my garmin battery die yesterday, so as I&#8217;m charging it prior to hitting the sunny streets, I was googling &#8220;qualifying new york marathon&#8221;. üôÇ

I came across the following, and my heart absolutely dropped:

_Runners who meet the following qualifying time standards:  
Open (Age 18-39)*  
Marathon Half-Marathon  
Women 3:18:00 1:34:00_

I could have sworn the numbers for the 2008 race were 3:23:00 and 1:37:00. How could I have been mistaken?

And then I took a closer look at other details on the site.. 

_(Those who have applied but been denied entry for the last three years in a row (2002, 2003, and 2004).)_

Yes, evidently the race directors decided that even though this year&#8217;s information is up at <http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/entrantinfo/applyfor2008.php>, they should not remove the page at <http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/entrantinfo/appolicy.php>. 

Just to get my lil heart racing a bit, I guess! üôÅ
