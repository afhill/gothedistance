I had wanted to get up early to get in a good longerish run on the treadmill. I set my alarm for 5:15, and then managed not to actually turn it on! After work I headed to the gym, where I decided to break up the monotony of the treadmill by increasing my pace a little with every mile.

1: 8:56  
2: 8:49  
3. 8:41  
4. 8:26  
5. 8:12  
6. 7:59  
7. 7:45  
8. 7:35  
9. 7:23  
10 9:13 (cooldown)

Overall pace was 8:18. Average heart rate was 166, max was 181. I felt pretty good, although my legs felt a little &#8220;poundy&#8221; at the end.
