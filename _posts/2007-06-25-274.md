So I am in Canada, visiting my parents. My Mom is in the throes of half-marathon training, so this morning we went out for a 16K run. She has a garmin and does 10/1 walk breaks, and my Dad came along on his bike. I just got into town last night and the run was a fantastic opportunity for us to chat. We ran around their neighbourhood: they had just moved here shortly before my last visit three years ago so I got thoroughly lost quite quickly. It was really pretty though; we ran looking down over the river valley.

Hard to believe that the last time I was in Edmonton, I ran the &#8220;Moose is Loose&#8221; Half marathon, and was just on the verge of signing up for my first marathon (In fact, I think I may have signed up for it from this very chair.. I know I signed up for a runners world magazine subscription here)

I also told my mom about the [Phedippidations podcast](http://www.steverunner.com), I think that could be a great motivator for her. Today is a day off, but we&#8217;re running again tomorrow and I told her she could try out my MP3 player to see if she thinks she&#8217;d like one.
