This morning I met with [TI Coach Danny Peleg](http://www.swimbetter.co/) for a private lesson. I bought the TI book and video,but I knew that was really no substitute for a coach. 

I met with Danny and he explained some of the background of the Total Immersion program to me; nothing that was a big surprise. Generally he works with athletes for a series of 6 lessons, focusing on specific drills. He cautioned me that often athletes get frustrated around lesson 4 or 5 because they&#8217;re not yet doing full stroke swimming. I was glad he mentioned it, but I&#8217;m definitely ok taking things a little bit at a time. 

Right off the bat he had me swim the length of the pool three times: once he video-taped me from the front, once from the side and once beneath the water. My stroke rate was 20 for one length of the pool: our goal will be to decrease that over the series. 

We then focused on some very basic things like gliding and working on balance. He was in the water with me and would give me feedback in real time (by just tapping my head so I&#8217;d realize I wasn&#8217;t looking straight down, etc). This was exactly why I signed up for private lessons! 

Oh &#8211; here&#8217;s Danny doing the Superman Glide. It&#8217;s actually not as simple to keep your legs up as you may think or hope. He gave me some advice on using my core to try to retain balance, but also to try to keep my shoulders at the surface. I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out both of those together, as I basically &#8220;swam downward&#8221; to keep my legs afloat.



Overall it may have seemed like we didn&#8217;t go over much, but it was amazing how even adding a tiny bit more complexity caused me to forget some of the earlier things we&#8217;d worked on. 

He also video-taped me during the drills and we could review them in real time, which was cool. My head position was actually ok once I started stroking &#8211; at least while he was taping ðŸ™‚ 

It was really helpful to have him in the water with me, sometimes gently pulling me along so I could feel the water resistance when I was &#8216;less-streamlined&#8217;. 

The drills we worked on were from the book and DVD so they weren&#8217;t foreign to me, but it was definitely good to feel how they&#8217;re supposed to feel! I know that heading back to the pool again now to practice, I&#8217;ll have a better sense of what to work on. 

I&#8217;m looking forward to this!
