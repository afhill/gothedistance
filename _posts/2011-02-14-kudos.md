Yesterday Frida and Queen from RMRG completed their [90 Day Total Body Transformation](http://90daytbt.wordpress.com) program. I&#8217;ve been following their progress way back since November, and it&#8217;s been incredibly inspiring. I&#8217;ve grabbed some good ideas about nutrition and working out. I&#8217;m even going to go see Eli, the personal trainer Frida recently met with.

Selfishly, I&#8217;m sad their journey is over. I&#8217;ve really looked forward to seeing how they&#8217;re doing, and I really do hope they continue to blog. I used to read more running blogs and I enjoyed learning from this one, seeing what I can apply to my own training and health. I&#8217;d even be tempted to tag along with them again if they were to decide to do it another time (hint, hint!)
