Dried apricots, almonds  
Tokyo joes veggie bowl

Two moms in the raw gojiberry granola

Felt good at practice, and I chatted a bit with one of our other jammers who was having a great day. She&#8217;d lifted earlier in the day and we both agreed that it feels good to be warm at scrimmage from earlier exercise. I really do like morning workouts. Well, and afternoon workouts ðŸ™‚ my office may possibly be transitioning to letting me work from home, which would be AMAZING. I used to work out in the afternoons pretty consistently at my old job (we had a gym on campus). It actually boosted my productivity as I felt really refreshed and energized after my break. I&#8217;m hoping it comes to fruition!
