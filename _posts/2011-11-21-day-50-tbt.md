Food  
&#8211; Ezekiel cereal, fat-free milk, blackberries, chia seeds, hemp seed  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; kombucha  
&#8211; vegan banana bread with pecans, chia seeds, poppyseeds and carob chips  
&#8211; vegetable lentil soup  
&#8211; apple  
&#8211; hard boiled egg  
&#8211; banana  
&#8211; baked butternut squash, brown rice, wilted greens

Exercise  
&#8211; 1hr &#8220;strong body&#8221; class. Part of it was doing 4 flights of stairs. I flew!  
&#8211; bench press  
&#8211; abs  
&#8211; pull-ups  
&#8211; pushups

I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I feel like I&#8217;m struggling with pushups lately. I feel like my back is sagging. Is it possible as I work on my chest, I&#8217;m becoming imbalanced with my back? Also, I saw a tweet today that it&#8217;s only 100 days til the Arnold Classic. I need to figure out this bench press thing STAT!
