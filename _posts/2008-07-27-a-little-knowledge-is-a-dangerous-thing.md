Last week I got my garmin cadence sensor in the mail. I was terribly excited with this toy, although I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what I was to do with it. 

A few of my twitter friends, [@melissabernais](http://www.twitter.com/melissabernais) and [@paulmoneysmith](http://www.twitter.com/paulmoneysmith), sent me some links, from which I learned that a biking cadence of 80-90 is ideal, and that [biking at 70 is roughly the equivalent of running an 8 minute mile](http://www.trinewbies.com/tno_running/tno_runarticle_07.asp). I found that particularly interesting, as I seem pretty comfortable biking at 70, and my marathon PR is an 8mm.

<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/cyclingstocksmall.jpg" alt="" title="Stock photography from Stock.XCHNG" width="281" height="188" class="alignright size-full wp-image-503" style="border: 2px solid #666" /> Today I set out with Melissa for a ride, with the goal to try to get stay in this 80-90 range. I tend to cycle on a harder gear so that I feel the resistance, but then I am not able to sustain it. I hoped that by forcing a faster turnover I would naturally gear down. 

I will admit I&#8217;m a bit confused about some of what I&#8217;ve read about fast-twitch vs slow-twitch muscle fibers. I have always associated fast-twitch fibers as those used by sprinters or short distance runners. As an endurance athlete, I use more slow-twitch fibers. I&#8217;ve always made the natural association that fast-twitch = fast turnover, slow-twitch=slower turnover. Yet in an article I read last night about [cycling cadence](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/cms/article-detail.asp?articleid=433), it stated that it was the fast-twitch fibers that were recruited during times when you were using more power (i.e. harder gear, slower cycling).  
I suppose it does make sense when you consider that sprinters have absolutely explosive leg power, but it still seems like the definitions don&#8217;t line up. 

Every week when I&#8217;m out with Melissa I tell her I need to just practice my leg turn-over, with no resistance. Yet to some extent I can&#8217;t help but wonder if that means I&#8217;m not really leveraging the power I have in my legs from thousands of miles of running. Although perhaps I need to look at it the other way: this cycling will help my running, if not the other way around..
