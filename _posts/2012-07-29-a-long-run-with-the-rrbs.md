I started running with the Running Republic of Boulder back in November, but because I was still living in Denver at the time, I never jumped in on the group&#8217;s Sunday long runs. Now that training has started for the [Columbus Marathon](http://www.columbusmarathon.com/) and I live here in town, I&#8217;ll be joining them more frequently.

I met the gang at the Left Hand Trailhead and we started off. I hadn&#8217;t been that way before and wasn&#8217;t really sure what to expect.

I generally like to follow the &#8220;one challenge per workout&#8221; strategy &#8211; if you run long, you run slower and don&#8217;t try to take on a challenging course. Apparently, this is not the group strategy üôÇ Before we started, Fred mentioned that Darren had told him to aim for an 8:30 pace &#8211; but this wasn&#8217;t some piddly flat bike path!

It was a pretty course, a fair amount of narrow track over some hills. I started out near the back of the group with Fred, Laura and Rick. It was a tough run with some significant ups and downs, and I&#8217;ve determined I really don&#8217;t like running on gravelly roads as I feel like I slip around a bit. 

I decided this would be the run for me to try out some [UCAN SuperStarch](http://www.generationucan.com/plain.html) in my water bottle. It claimed it has no taste, but that&#8217;s not entirely true. It tastes like something starchy is in your water. üôÅ It didn&#8217;t upset my stomach or anything at all, but it wasn&#8217;t a nice refreshing drink. I&#8217;ll definitely throw in some sort of flavoring the next time I use it. (Verdict is still out if it helped &#8211; but this is the longest training run I&#8217;ve done in quite some time!)

Around mile 8 or so I really started to struggle, but I kept chugging along. I&#8217;ll admit that not knowing the route helped keep me moving, but I also knew that this is what long runs are supposed to be like: not easy. I think I&#8217;ve developed a bad habit of not wanting to push through the discomfort of long runs, and that needs to stop! Around mile 9 we took a brief water break and I ditched my tank top and felt a bit better. After a brief uphill things leveled off a bit and I felt like I could just let myself go. And then our cars were in sight! Huh? We were supposed to be on a 12 mile loop, but we must have missed a turn because we were back at the trailhead around 10.3.

I was thankful for a brief moment, and then I shook it off and realized I still had several more miles to go. Some of the group had tacked on 4 miles before the run, but I had left it til after. Lydia and Fred wanted to get in another 1.6 miles so I joined them on the roads, then continued on on my own. 

Honestly, it was good for me to get that time by myself. Sure, the roads were easier so that was a nice way to end the run feeling better, but it was also good for me not to feel like I was running at someone else&#8217;s pace. I was surprised to see the pace was still decent. In my mind, I was doing an easy extended cooldown, just getting the miles in. But they actually weren&#8217;t too bad, pace-wise.

Because the trails were a bit short, I ended up back at my car before reaching 16 miles. [Colleen](http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/colleen-de-reuck-1.html) and [JZ](http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ze/joanna-zeiger-1.html) were out there after their run and offered me something to drink. I wondered how they were feeling with the Olympics going on &#8211; both have competed before. I was curious if that made them more rabid fans or not, but felt silly asking.  
Before too long I set out again to finish off my last mile. In some ways it felt a bit arbitrary, but I wanted the mental prep as much as the physical.

Yes, as we were running over these silly hills today, I mentioned to a few folks that I&#8217;m used to running an easier route for a long run. But they said, and I agreed, that this was much better mental training. That&#8217;s for sure! This run definitely took more out of me than running on a bike path would have; my legs had to handle the beating from the hills and keep on going. 

So between yesterday and today, I managed to log 27 miles, whoa! Although I haven&#8217;t been feeling super fresh lately, I have to just know that each of these workouts is bringing me closer to my goal. And really, Columbus isn&#8217;t that far away! Less than 3 months til I toe that oh-so-familiar line!
