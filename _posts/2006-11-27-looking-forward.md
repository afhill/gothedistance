I still would like to qualify for NYC for this fall, so my attempt will be at [The Athens (Ohio) Half-Marathon](http://www.athensmarathon.org). It&#8217;s two weeks before Paris, which is always a nice way to start a taper. 

Start the mantra: 1:37:00&#8230; 1:37:00&#8230;. 

I will have to work out a training schedule that gets in the speedwork I&#8217;ll need! I had wanted to be doing treadmill workouts already, but I&#8217;ve been busy, and then came down with the chicken pox and am confined to the house (no, I don&#8217;t have a treadmill here, which is too bad since I have all this time on my hands!)
