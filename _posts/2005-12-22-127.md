the last day of work before vacation is rough.. no work to do, so I just 

&#8211; signed up for the Disney 5K family Fun Run (to run with my Mom)  
&#8211; registered for the Crown King Scramble 50K in March  
&#8211; booked my flight to AZ in March (well, using my folks&#8217; CC &#8211; merry Christmas to me!)
