I came to a good realization as I did my [Yasso 800](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-244-255-624-0,00.html) workout today. **Not everything is a test**. Sure this is something I should have figured out long ago, but I simply hadn&#8217;t. Through all my schooling, I&#8217;ve been trained to focus on achievement, which is often correlated with testing and validation. I&#8217;m the girl who &#8220;doesn&#8217;t like&#8221; anything she&#8217;s not good at. However, I need to realize that not everything can be learned without practice and failed effort. 

Today&#8217;s workout was a doozy: 15-30min warm-up, 8-10x(800m in 3:23), 15-30min cool-down. 

<!--more-->I found a track at a local school, but decided to use my garmin for the distance rather than relying on the marks on the track. As a result, my 800m became 0.5 miles (the actual distance is 0.497), and my target pace was 6:46mm.

For anyone not familiar with the Yasso 800 pace predictor (and not interested in clicking the link above), this is a pace predictor workout devised by Bart Yasso. The idea is that if you can run 10x800m in 3 minutes 23 seconds, you&#8217;re in shape for a 3:23:00 marathon, if you can run them in 2 minutes 50 seconds, you&#8217;re in shape for a 2:50 marathon. There has been plenty of criticism on this method of prediction, but the final word I&#8217;ve read on it is that it should be seen not as a sign of what you&#8217;re capable of, but what you&#8217;re not. That is, if you _can&#8217;t_ run them, you&#8217;re probably not ready for that pace. 

It was a gorgeous day out today, and after a relaxing morning and some Black Friday shopping, I set out to the school around 3pm, in a t-shirt and shorts. I arrived at the school and found it rather windy and a bit colder than I expected. I knew right away that this wasn&#8217;t going to be easy. I started my warm-up, and my knee gave a bit of a twinge, reminding me of its fine performance in the [race yesterday](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/11/united-way-turkey-trot/ "United Way Turkey Trot Race Report").

So, ready for the results of the workout?

The reflection and the lessons came around the 3rd and 4th interval. After the intervals I had to breathe deep.. there is this moment sometimes when my heart feels like it is beating right out of my chest, and I need to take a huge breath to try to expand my lungs to harness my heart back in towards my body. During the intervals I felt my spirit and my legs start to abandon me, and I was cursing myself about it. In the middle of the 5th interval I actually stopped my watch and considered quitting. And that&#8217;s (thankfully) when I had a revelation. Yes, the Yasso 800 in intended to be a predictor, but **today wasn&#8217;t a test**. It was how I was going to prepare for the big day. Stopping because it was hard and saying &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t&#8221; wasn&#8217;t going to get me there. So I forced myself to keep going. And lo and behold, it wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought it was going to end up! After the first few intervals (which were way too fast), I was worried that I&#8217;d pushed myself too fast at the start and would pay for it later. I may have, but in the end I still managed the average I was aiming for, and I trust that I will start to get to know the pace better and be able to moderate it better next time.

I&#8217;ve never been a great fan of speedwork, because it does tack on that added pressure of meeting a certain pace. But today I gave myself permission to just go out and train and have that be &#8220;enough&#8221; and I think that should help me mentally manage this moving forward. As I debated quitting today, I thought about the speedwork I&#8217;ve done with <a href="http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/" title="Meredith Gordon" rel="friend">Meredith</a> over the years, and how I never would have quit if she and I were both on the track; we would just do the best we could because it would have been a training exercise. That&#8217;s how I have to see my runs on my own, as well. 

I say I love to run, and I do better when I have a plan. I think that is because I am very achievement-motivated and it helps me to have something to check off at the end of the day. Yet I have to recognize that some workouts aren&#8217;t going to be easy, and it&#8217;s ok not to hit the target every time. That&#8217;s the point of training: so that step by step, I can reach those goals. But stopping a workout just because it&#8217;s hard ain&#8217;t gonna cut it. It&#8217;s like what Mike said to me during [my first marathon in 2004](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2004/10/columbus-marathon-race-report-2/ "Columbus Marathon 2004 Race Report"), &#8220;if it were easy, everyone would do it&#8221;.
