I probably can&#8217;t pretend it&#8217;s related, but I&#8217;ve had great long sleeps the last two nights!

Food:  
&#8211; hawaiian omelet at Au Coquelet &#8211; pineapple, spinach, black olives, tomatoes. I never would have come up with pineapple in an omelet, but it was GOOD!  
&#8211; rye bread  
&#8211; fresh squeezed oj  
&#8211; peanut curry with brown rice from [Gecko Gecko](http://www.yelp.com/biz/gecko-gecko-berkeley). I&#8217;ve been eying this place since the first time we came to Berkeley. This is probably my last trip to see this client, so I&#8217;m glad I checked it out! (wish I&#8217;d done it sooner)  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; canary melon  
&#8211; spinach masala dosa from [Udupi Palace](http://www.yelp.com/biz/udupi-palace-berkeley). A dosa is a rice/lentil crepe, so probably not 100% TBT-approved.  
&#8211; banana

Exercise  
&#8211; 100 pushups  
&#8211; 100 lunges, each leg  
&#8211; 400 crunches  
&#8211; 100 bootstrappers
