I got a comment a couple days ago from a member of the Incline Club asking when I was going to head on down to the Springs to run with them again. That was all the nudge I needed to get up at 5am and drive to Manitou!

I arrived at the park planning to run to Barr Camp, but some of the folks were doing to do a 3-2-1 from the top (drive to the summit, go down-and-up 3, then down-and-up 2, then down-and-up 1). I decided that if I&#8217;m going to get altitude, I may as well get a LOT, so I went with them.

I haven&#8217;t been running much, and haven&#8217;t been above 10K feet this year, so I told Tracey before we started that I was going to do down-and-up 3, and then have french fries at the top. So that&#8217;s what I did ðŸ™‚

The rocks at the top are pretty bad, I wouldn&#8217;t really call it running. Tracey and Darrell left me pretty quickly, but I caught up with them shortly before 2 miles. I passed them, and told them they&#8217;d catch me on the way back up. I hit the turn-around point (A-frame) in 43 minutes. I turned around and WHOOSH the climb hit me. They caught up with me with about a mile and a half to go. I was definitely struggling. With a half mile to go, I stopped just to breathe. I looked at my watch, it read 1:37. I reasoned that I could do a half mile in 8 minutes to finish in 1:45.

HAHAHAHAHHAH.

It&#8217;s pretty humbling when you can&#8217;t even pull off a 16 minute mile for a half mile, but I couldn&#8217;t. I reached the summit again at 1:50. 

I went inside, not feeling too bad. I got my french fries and a soda, and met up with another runner from the club. He&#8217;d run from the bottom (just shy of 13 miles) in 3:37 &#8211; his second-best time ever. 

We hung out at the top while I patiently waited for the rest of the group. Eventually Mike finished &#8211; he completed the whole 3-2-1 for the first time ever &#8211; and we reminisced about the time I cut my hand open on the trail. It was crazy to think about all the snow there&#8217;d been that day &#8211; we saw none today. Then we decided to get our blood oxygen levels checked. Mine was at 80, which didn&#8217;t excite the EMT. I&#8217;d actually be interested to know what it is normally in Denver. 

Eventually the whole gang met up and we headed down the mountain. I feel a little out of sorts today, but I figured that was a hard workout and I&#8217;m really glad I did it. I love the comradery of the group &#8211; honestly, the riding up to the top is great as everyone is sharing stories, etc, and you can&#8217;t beat the scenery. 

It&#8217;s been a long time since I went to Manitou on a Sunday &#8211; I&#8217;ll admit twisting my ankle in the winter made me a bit nervous, so I taped my ankles today &#8211; but I definitely know I need to get back to making it a priority!
