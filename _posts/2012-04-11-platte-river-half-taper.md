I&#8217;m looking forward to it, in a weird calm way. 

When I finished the [Denver Rock and Roll Half](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/10/rock-and-roll-denver-half-marathon-race-report/) in 1:33 in the fall, I&#8217;d barely wiped the sweat off my brow before wondering how much harder 1:30 would really be?

And that was before I started training with the [Running Republic of Boulder](http://www.runningrepublic.com), which I know has really made a difference in my running. I pulled off a surprising race in Houston, faster than I thought I was capable of (although exactly what my coach predicted). (According to the [McMillan pace predictor](http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/calculator), a 1:30:02 is the equivalent to my 3:09:52 marathon)

My coach and I set the 1:30 goal back in January, but I even feel as though I&#8217;ve made improvements since then. One of the guys I run with most frequently in group runs recently pulled off a 1:27 half (granted, at sea level). If anything, I find that I have trouble holding a 6:51 pace in training and often end up slipping closer to 6:45 pace.

Last week we had a few 10 minute intervals in training that were supposed to be at HMP, and even with varying terrain I ended up running exactly at 6:52. 

So in all, I&#8217;m feeling pretty confident going into Sunday. While the weather looks less than favorable (the forecast is for showers, with a high of 45), I don&#8217;t have any concerns about my fitness. Work has been a bit crazy this week but it&#8217;s keeping my mind off my cutback in mileage. The hay is in the barn, and I can&#8217;t wait to burn it down!
