Oh no.. not yet&#8230;

But my knee troubles are going on three weeks (I didn&#8217;t realize it was really that long until I wrote the date down on my patient intake form at the doc today) and I&#8217;m definitely not running anytime soon. 

The PA I spoke with today suggested I work out up to my comfort level, which I know is no running. So she suggested biking or swimming..

**_Of course she would. This is Boulder! Everyone swimbikeruns!!!!_**

I&#8217;ve had several friends suggest I bike and it&#8217;s not my favorite thing to do, but I&#8217;m starting to open my mind to it. I&#8217;ve always said I wouldn&#8217;t take up triathlon because there were other stuff I&#8217;d rather do.. like rock-climb, crossfit or TRX. But all those things require good strong knees. So who knows, until then, maybe I could stand to try some of this other stuff???

(probably not actually swimming. Too much hassle, and I&#8217;m really not good and would have to take lessons). But&#8230; maybe&#8230;.
