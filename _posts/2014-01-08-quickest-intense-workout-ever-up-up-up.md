When I was going to Crossfit a couple years ago, one of the instructor tacked on a &#8220;dessert&#8221; workout after the main WOD. It was intense but simple, and I&#8217;ve come back to it a few times after the years. Today I wanted to get in a quick workout and it wore me out after just a couple minutes. I realized I need to share this with the world!

You do need a medicine ball for this, I have the [Valeo MB8 8-Pound Medicine Ball](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007IS73C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0007IS73C&linkCode=as2&tag=afhill-20)<img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afhill-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B0007IS73C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

### Laddered V-Ups and Pushups

Then raise your arms and legs, touching the ball to your feet. So imagine her holding the medicine ball in her hands throughout. 

Go through a ladder and reverse ladder:  
10 V-ups, 1 pushup  
9 V-ups, 2 pushups  
8 V-ups, 3 pushups  
&#8230;.  
1 V-up, 10 pushups.

Mentally you get the relief of decreasing on one exercise, although things are getting harder on the far side. If you can&#8217;t do all the reps at once, take a bit of a breather and continue on. For pushups I hold the plank while I recoup.

Seriously, this one exercise is a workout in and of itself!
