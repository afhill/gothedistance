Today [Kenya announced its entrants for the Olympics marathon](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/17843408). 

With the abundance of talented runners from the country, the task of selecting which runners would head to London was not trivial. But for all the talent, a few names have earned some recognition state-side: 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mutai_GeoffreyM-Berlin10-280x421-199x300.jpg" alt="" title="Mutai_GeoffreyM-Berlin10-280x421" width="199" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4050" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mutai_GeoffreyM-Berlin10-280x421.jpg)**Geoffrey Mutai** &#8211; Boston 2011: ran the world&#8217;s fastest marathon, New York 2011: broke the course record  
**Patrick Makau** &#8211; Berlin 2011: set the world record

However, neither will be setting any records in the Olympics in London in 2012, as neither was selected for the team.

At first blush, this seems ridiculous. Two of the fastest men in the world, why would they not be selected for the Olympics? However, sometimes what we don&#8217;t do can speak as loudly as what we do.  
  
**Geoffrey Mutai** &#8211; Boston 2012 DNF  
**Patrick Makau** &#8211; London 2012 DNF

We don&#8217;t know why these men didn&#8217;t finish their races, but we can safely assume that this was _interpreted as weakness: be it physical or mental_. Certainly in the past these men have come out on top, but the selection committee must make their decision on who they think will perform best in the future. Regardless of what they did several months ago, within the past several weeks these men were unable to complete the distance they&#8217;re expected to excel at. Who is to stay they will be able to be back on top in only a few months?

If the past were all that mattered, we wouldn&#8217;t bother with the Games at all. That being said, these men HAVE proven themselves superior to all others at one time or another. Did they &#8220;earn&#8221; their spot to the Olympics? That begs the question if the Olympics should be considered a type of reward for past displays of excellence, or if potential is paramount.

**What do you think of the decision to leave out these athletes?**
