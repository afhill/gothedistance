We have some slight differences in our interpretation of what&#8217;s ok and what&#8217;s not, notably around sweeteners and to some extent, the glycemic index. 

I see eating clean as cutting out junk- not taking in nutritionally void calories. Particularly since I expend a lot of calories, and in line with my earlier post about [Food as Fuel](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/11/food-as-fuel/), I want what I ingest to be good for me. I avoid white flour, white sugar and white rice as they&#8217;re nutritionally void. 

By my rules, sweeteners like agave or honey are ok, although I try to stay away from some of the treats they&#8217;re in, cookies and the like. Again, if I need to take in so many calories a day, I&#8217;d rather eat something of nutritional value. 

_**Note:** I think it&#8217;s worth stating I don&#8217;t track calories or intake at all. I just know I have reasonably high nutritional requirements and want what I take it to serve my body._ 

Frida&#8217;s take on sweeteners seems at the same time more simple and less straightforward. Based moreso on the [glycemic index](http://www.glycemicindex.com/), foods that spike your blood sugar (which includes white rice and white sugar, among others) are bad. Foods with a lower glycemic index are better. 

I actually don&#8217;t fully understand the implications of spiking your blood sugar (although it was discussed a bit in [Fat Head](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/11/fat-head/)), and in particular the notion that eating a low GI food can lower the GI of the entire meal just confounds me. 

Regardless, it&#8217;s fascinating to me that while on the surface we both follow the same diet of Eating Clean (she arguably more stringently that I), we have different reasons for doing so. It reminds me of religion wherein we each have our own reasons for the path we&#8217;ve selected. 

For those who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve always been a sugar fan. My Starbucks drink of choice was a [peppermint white chocolate mocha](http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/peppermint-white-chocolate-mocha) with hazelnut syrup, which contains 94g of sugar. I avoided diet sodas (not being a fan of artificial sweeteners) and drank full sugar-sweetened when I did drink soda (in Canada, soda is sweetened with sugar, not HFCS). At movies I went for twizzlers, not popcorn. Dropping sugar could have been hard for me. But if I consider the fact this stuff offers my body nothing nutritionally, it just makes sense. 

Recently, another friend has decided to attempt to give up sugar. I hope she&#8217;ll see the success we have, and I wonder about her own path that has lead her to this place. I&#8217;m heartened by her decision bc I feel my change in nutrition has greatly helped me this year and I hope she finds the same.

Earlier this year I half-watched a video called &#8220;Sugar: the Bitter Truth&#8221;. While I&#8217;m still not entirely convinced that sugar from fruit is evil, there is some interesting information to be learned:
