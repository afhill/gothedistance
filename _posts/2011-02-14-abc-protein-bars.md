Today I made a modified version of [ABC Protein bars](http://liftforlife.com/content/bodybuilding-fitness-diet-health-articles/diet-articles/727-protein-bar#ABC_Protein_Bars)

Ingredients:  
5 tbsp. natural peanut butter  
2 egg whites  
4 tbs hemp pro fiber powder  
1 cup oats  
1/4 cup almond milk  
1 tbs flax seed  
1/4 cup apple-sweetened dried cranberries  
dust of cinnamon on top

Because I used hemp protein instead of artificially flavored chocolate-mint protein powder, I was a bit worried about the taste, so I added in the cranberries to try to lighten it up. I didn&#8217;t have 5 egg whites so I only used 2, but then halved the rest of the recipe instead of making it 40%. Whoops!

Basically, I think they look like turds ðŸ™‚ 

But the verdict? Overall, I think they taste decent. I used the same oats that I didn&#8217;t like to eat on their own, so I&#8217;m not sure why I thought I&#8217;d like them within the bar. Also, there are a few spots that don&#8217;t taste like much, which I blame more on my mixing than anything else. I&#8217;m glad I added the cranberries, and I&#8217;d consider coconut in a future attempt. Which is really weird since I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever thought about adding coconut to ANYTHING before, ever. They certainly don&#8217;t look very attractive, but this isn&#8217;t all about looks. For the time and money they cost to make, I&#8217;d definitely consider doing this again. 

I compared them to the probar superfood slam that I had on my way to practice today (scaling up the calories to make the serving equivalent, but this is what I&#8217;d consider two servings of the ABC bar). It looks like the sodium is super-high on my bars, but that&#8217;s because LiveStrong thinks there is added sodium in my almond butter. However, I use the grinder to make it, so I know that this is all just almonds (which have no sodium). So overall my ABC bars win out over the commercial brand (except in, you know, looking good)
