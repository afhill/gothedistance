I can&#8217;t recall how many people have asked if I&#8217;d read, and recommended, &#8220;[Born to Run](http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307266303)&#8220;. From conversations and reviews, I&#8217;d picked up but one part of the story: the Tarahumara are a tribe of runners with amazing endurance who eat pinole and chia. It was nearly a year ago that I got &#8220;[Fuel Your Run The Tarahumara Way](http://pinolerecipes.com/)&#8221; as an add-on e-book from Matt Frazier at [No Meat Athlete](http://www.nomeatathlete.com/). But I had no idea how many of today&#8217;s running trends (and how many personally compelling figures and places) would be surfaced in this captivating book.

The story and characters are fascinating, nearly to the point where you wonder if this isn&#8217;t actually a work of fiction. (Note: Jenn Shelton, featured in the book, has criticized it for romanticizing the lives of the Tarahumara). 

The book interspersed narrative with a good blend of backstory and science, which I enjoyed immensely. It&#8217;s the type of book where you close it and immediately open a web browser to learn more about what&#8217;s mentioned.

I guess I was aware on some level that &#8220;Born to Run&#8221; had been embraced by the barefoot running communiy, but I had no idea there&#8217;d be some million dollar publicity for [Vibram FiveFingers](http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm) in the book (Barefoot Ted, another of the characters, was their first sponsored athlete), as well as some scientific discussion on the perils of modern-day footwear. It didn&#8217;t seem preachy (which I appreciated) but I&#8217;m sure many readers took the information to heart and changed their footwear. 

There were a few pleasant cameo appearances in the book as well, I loved reading about Scott Jurek and Ann Trason and the Leadville 100.. the Leadville 100 has surfaced a few times lately, I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s a sign I&#8217;m meant to sign up for the [Leadville Trail Marathon](http://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/page/show/311972-leadville-trail-marathon) when registration opens next Tuesday. (Yes, just the marathon. Not the whole she-bang.. yet ðŸ˜‰ )

I&#8217;m not particularly a fan of fiction-I&#8217;ll admit to reading Dan Brown and Jeanette Winterson novels because of how thy include some &#8220;smarts&#8221; to them, be it history or physics, but still have an overall narrative feel. McDougall answers my dilemma of an entertaining read with that compulsion to be learning at the same time. 

The story was great, and I definitely found myself wanting to know more about the characters. Thankfully since they&#8217;re real, that&#8217;s a true possibility. 

&#8220;Born to Run&#8221; is the type of book that stands to change a culture of runners. I wish I could have predicted that two years ago when the book was first published, as we can already see the impact of the book. If you are, as Matt Frazier once wrote, &#8220;one of the six remaining runners on the planet who have yet to read Born to Run&#8221;, go do it now.
