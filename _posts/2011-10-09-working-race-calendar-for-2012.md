As always, post-race before I even have time to rehydrate completely, I&#8217;m planning what&#8217;s next. Actually, I&#8217;ve been thinking about the next year for awhile. My calendar is already filling up!  
I&#8217;m torn: I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the shorter distances this year, but after this weekend I can&#8217;t help but think that my marathon PR needs to fall as well..
