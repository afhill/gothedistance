yesterday I scraped my leg up sliding in softball. I wasn&#8217;t too worried about it, but when I woke up this morning, my quad was hurting as well. Today I&#8217;m supposed to do 10 miles, with 5 at half marathon pace.. and it&#8217;s 86degrees. Yuck! Last time I did a run w/ some at half-MP, I did it on the treadmill, so I knew the pace, but I wasn&#8217;t setting it myself. Today I&#8217;m going to Antrim.. hopefully I can gauge my pace accurately!

On the runnersworld forums, there are more and more posts about ppl dropping out of Chicago. Makes me sad &#8211; I&#8217;m really starting to wish I&#8217;d registered for it. Joy, Andrea and many of the 6am sisters seem to be running it. Oh well, some other year I guess&#8230;.
