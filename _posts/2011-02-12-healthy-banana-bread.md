Remember when this blog used to be about running? Yeah&#8230; I have nothing to say about that :-/

Today&#8217;s culinary adventure was &#8220;healthy banana bread&#8221;. As I&#8217;ve been trying to buy a lot more fresh fruit, I don&#8217;t get to all of it in time so I needed to do something with my over-ripe bananas. I found this [clean eating banana bread recipe](http://cleaneatingclub.com/clean-eating-recipes/baked-goods/healthy-banana-bread-makeover/) and decided to give it a try. It&#8217;s actually nice that I&#8217;m actually cultivating a kitchen that HAS the ingredients in it!

I used all spelt flour, tripled the cinnamon, added a quarter cup of dried hazelnuts and some wheat germ. I know in some baking recipes I&#8217;ve seen, applesauce has been added for sweetening. Since I obviously won&#8217;t be slathering this with butter, I wonder how that would have turned out.

Since I was in the kitchen this morning anyway, I decided to make coffee for the first time in weeks. Bigger news is that I threw out my sweetened &#8216;hazelnut&#8217; creamer and just used almondmilk as creamer. It doesn&#8217;t taste or look as good, but I&#8217;ve decided I don&#8217;t need that jolt of sugar in my caffeine to start the day.
