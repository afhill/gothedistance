I&#8217;m very type-A, it&#8217;s good for me to have goals and structure. Yet too often that can lead to stress and burnout. Today I had a great mix of structure and fun!

Think a pub crawl, but where you run between stops. Loren and KJ started with me, but both peeled off before we finished. I was nice and chatty with many of the other runners. The run was an extension of the Highland Tap and Burger Run Club, so I met some of their regulars and it&#8217;ll be easy for me to start running with them (every Wed evening at 6:15, two blocks from home). It was fun to spend 6 hours with random runners. It was actually hilarious: there was the annual Zombie Crawl going on today and often people would stare at us moreso than the Zombies lurching by. 

So, it was a fun 10 miles. So where does the balance come in? Well, I had 18 on the schedule for today. So I compromised: 10.4 serious miles this morning (target was 8:23, I ran 8:21 pace) before the Beer Run. So all in all I ran about 20 miles, even though the afternoon was broken into short stints between beer stops.

I had a blast. Met some new folks &#8211; volunteered to help out for a elementary school run on Monday and may go for a run tomorrow with some gals. Pushed hard on the runs and enjoyed the day. SO much fun!
