And&#8230;. I woke up sick. 10 days before my big marathon, dammit. At least I decided not to run the Goofy Challenge this week and not run down my immune system more. 

I should have seen it coming, with all the sleep I felt I needed late last week. Even Sat back in CO I slept something like 10 hours. I had a big NYE (staying up late) and my runs since then have sucked. 

My Dad was diagnosed with acute bronchitis while I was there so I&#8217;m just thankful I&#8217;m not feeling anything in my chest.. but I made sure I went to the store this morning and loaded up on mucinex, oranges, and saline pacakges for my neti-pot.. Wow, this is thrilling, isn&#8217;t it?

</div>

  * chai tea with extra ginger and turmeric
  * blueberry ginger chia pudding. (A variation of this: [strawberry ginger chia pudding](http://www.choosingraw.com/strawberry-ginger-chia-pudding).) Weird consistency but not bad!
  * quinoa salad with black beans
  * two pieces of Udi&#8217;s sourdough bread.. dammit, I was so excited to find bread without added sugar, I completely spaced on the fact this just says &#8220;wheat flour&#8221; (not whole wheat). It only has three ingredients: wheat flour, water and sea salt! üôÅ
  * gardenburger portabello mushroom burger with vegan cheese and avocado on that same sourdough bread. I&#8217;ll hit up the store again tomorrow 
  * homemade kombucha
  * hard boiled egg
  * almond butter, hemp seed, green apple on toasted Ezekiel bread (yes, I went to the store)
  * 2 big glasses of fresh-squeezed OJ
  * pan-seared tofu (marinated in citrus habanero oil with a ton of spices), wilted spinach with lemon, brown rice
  * more chia pudding
  * raw cashew cheese and purple rice crackers
  * almond milk with cayenne pepper, turmeric, ginger

#### Exercise

Since I felt like crud when I woke up, I decided to take it easy today. But then on FitSugar.com I saw they had a challenge &#8211; how many pushups can you do in a minute. What has two thumbs and loves a challenge? This girl! I actually surprised myself and squeaked out 36! Often if I&#8217;m just doing pushups, I don&#8217;t go past 25 at a time. Sigh &#8211; I&#8217;m so competitive. But, I decided this was a great way to kick off doing the [100 Pushup Challenge](http://hundredpushups.com/test.html). I did it a few years ago, but with girlie pushups. I&#8217;m going to do the real deal this time! Starting at 36 puts me in week 4..

  * 36 pushups
  * Crossfit basics: press, push press, jerk.
  * half &#8220;Cindy&#8221; &#8211; 5 pullups, 10 pushups, 15 air squats &#8211; AMRAP in 10 min. I used a band for my pullups, no kipping as they haven&#8217;t showed that to us yet üôÇ I lost count, but other girls in the class thought I did 7 or 8 reps. I&#8217;ll go with 7-2. So 37 pullups, 70 pushups, 105 air squats Now THIS was a good workout, especially after the other 36 pushups this morning!

I&#8217;d told myself before heading to CF that I had the right to just come home and watch a movie and feel sorry for myself feeling sick, but I actually felt decent once I got my blood moving during my workout. Yay! (Still going to try to look after myself to really kick this thing)
