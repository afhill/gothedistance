9 days to the [Deadwood-Michelson Trail Marathon](http://www.marathonguide.com/races/racedetails.cfm?MIDD=1811150607)!

I&#8217;ve been meaning to run this race for years &#8211; I have a few friends from South Dakota who&#8217;ve really enjoyed it, but the timing hasn&#8217;t been right. We started planning back in January or so and ended up with a great group!

KJ and I will do the marathon, and Erin and Aaron and Queen and Jed and Sara and KJ&#8217;s sister will all do the half.

It&#8217;ll be a super fun trip, we&#8217;ll caravan cars on Friday to get out there, and then we&#8217;ve rented an awesome 4 bedroom cabin to stay in:

I&#8217;m pretty excited for this race for a few reasons: it&#8217;ll be a ton of fun to have a couples/friends trip to a race. It looks like a gorgeous race, and a new state for me. I&#8217;ve been feeling pretty good running lately, AND Sara is feeling good about her race! I wont be there to be next to her during this half, but she seems really mentally and physically strong. I cant wait to hear how it goes for her. 

I&#8217;ve actually never been to South Dakota before so we&#8217;re going to see Mt Rushmore and CrazyHorse, which will satisfy my &#8216;tourist&#8217; needs. 

I&#8217;ve been trying to get mentally ready for this one &#8211; cut out coffee and beer for the two weeks leading up to the race, and generally tried to eat better. I&#8217;ve cut my mileage nicely and am feeling that eagerness to see what I can do. 

I looked at the results from previous years, just curious what it would take to place in my age group. And of course, it all depends on who shows up:

2014: 3rd place F35-39: 4:09  
2013: 3rd place F35-39: 3:42  
2012: 3rd place F35-39: 4:14  
2011: 3rd place F35-39: 4:25

I guess I can just hope the peeps from 2013 don&#8217;t come back this year! ðŸ˜‰ Not that placing is of the utmost importance to me, but it&#8217;d be super fun to do well. 

The course isn&#8217;t super easy &#8211; check out this course-profile:

The first half looks pretty heinous but it&#8217;s actually about a 1% incline. Apparently it&#8217;s that sort of subtle incline where it wears you out and you feel slow and you don&#8217;t quite know why, so the trick is not to get frustrated by the effort. The second half looks fun ðŸ™‚

Race day plan: I think KJ wants to go out at 8-8:30 or something. I think I&#8217;ll run comfortable, probably closer to a 9, to be sure I&#8217;m feeling good for the second half. 

I definitely want to break four hours. Closer to 3:40 (8:21 pace) would be fantastic, but I know that&#8217;s a pretty quick pace if I&#8217;m planning for 9s on the first half..If I do the first half in 2hrs, that&#8217;s a 9:04 pace. But then the second half would have to be in 1:40, which is what I ran the [Rock n Roll half](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2014/10/rock-and-roll-denver-half-2014-race-report/) in in the fall..

I&#8217;m feeling pretty good! Orange Theory has helped a lot with general strength and fitness. KJ and I have had some solid runs in this training period so I&#8217;m pretty excited to see how things go! I&#8217;m definitely not as strong as she is, but I feel pretty good about where I am. We got in three 20s during this training period (ignore my off mileage &#8211; I had some challenges with starting and stopping my watch) and I also had three consistent 5Ks (22:12ish).  
I&#8217;ve got the endurance and some speed. My mental game seems strong too, so I&#8217;m excited to do this!
