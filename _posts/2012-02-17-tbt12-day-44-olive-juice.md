I was still feeling out of sorts today. I went to the grocery store and ended up with avocados, greek yogurt (2%), two kinds of cheese, a reese&#8217;s peanut butter egg and olives from the deli. I am going to be prepared for my cheat day!  
But the olive thing&#8230; so I used to HATE green olives. I&#8217;ve come to not mind them, but this is the second time this WEEK I&#8217;ve bought some from the deli for a snack.  
What are olives a good source of? Uh huh, fat. My body is definitely telling me something. I won&#8217;t be binging on sugar tomorrow &#8211; it&#8217;ll be on saturated fatty goodness.

#### Food

&#8211; Kashi cereal with kefir, banana, a touch of chocolate protein powder  
&#8211; bhakti chai/coffee blend.  
&#8211; sample larabar  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; whole foods salad bar  
&#8211; olives  
&#8211; banana &#8220;ice cream&#8221; (coconut milk, frozen bananas, chocolate protein powder)  
&#8211; chipins chips and fake cheese  
&#8211; sweet potato soup &#8211; had garam masala and chile powder, which made me think of chickpeas so I threw some of them in as well!  
&#8211; seeduction bread  
&#8211; greek yogurt and honey  
&#8211; veggie juice- I almost didn&#8217;t have this because of my poor attitude about my diet, but decided it wasn&#8217;t the veggies fault. Carrot, ginger, orange pepper, lemon. The recipe called for orange instead of lemon, sadly I used my last orange yesterday. The lemon was a bit much. 

#### Exercise

&#8211; An easy 3 miles
