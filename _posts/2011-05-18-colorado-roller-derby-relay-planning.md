Hard to believe that June is right around the corner, which means the details for the DRD/RMRG relay need to come together! 

We have pulled a team together with 6 people from each league, and we&#8217;ll be participating in the [Epic Rocky Mountain Relay](http://www.epicrelays.com/rmr-home) in July. Last night Frida and I got together to figure out van assignments and legs. We both laughed in a bit of incredulity at some of the legs.. I know this is Colorado, but come on!

The worst leg looks to be #22, which is a pretty steep uphill. Fun times&#8230; We assigned it to one runner, but then realized that it could actually be a great leg for one of the skaters who is training for Pikes Peak, so there may be a switcheroo. It&#8217;s tough to try to figure out what&#8217;s best for people &#8211; but from running a few of these, I think I know that everyone will make do with what they have!

I have a few more ideas of how the group can get ready for the adventure, and I still have plenty of logistics to work on, but at least this part is behind me! Hard to believe it&#8217;s only a couple months away!!

I took the hardest legs: Runner #8, so I have legs [8](http://www.epicrelays.com/uploads/Epic%20Rocky%20Mountain%20Relay%20Leg%208.pdf), [20](http://www.epicrelays.com/uploads/Epic%20Rocky%20Mountain%20Relay%20Leg%2020.pdf), [32](http://www.epicrelays.com/uploads/Epic%20Rocky%20Mountain%20Relay%20Leg%2032.pdf)
