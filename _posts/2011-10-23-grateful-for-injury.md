2011 has been a pretty outstanding year for me, running-wise. It&#8217;s really amazing when you consider how it started: with a [DNF at the Rock and Roll Arizona marathon](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/01/dnf/) in January. A diagnosis of hip bursitis. Physical therapy and a month off. Then in March a PCL tear and another month off. But somehow I still managed to wrack up the PRs, at the 5K, 5 mile, 10K and half marathon distance. I set a personal course record at the Pikes Peak marathon as well. Not bad considering the amount of time I spent NOT running.. but I can&#8217;t help but think that actually contributed to the success I&#8217;ve seen.

In January I was sent to physical therapy to help with my weak glutes and work on some major muscle imbalances between my two legs. I also started attending [Davis Boot Camp](http://www.denverfitnesstrainingcamp.com/), which helped me with overall strength and got me hooked on High Intensity Training (HIT). I love a challenge, so doing anything for just a minute is a great way for me to be sure to push myself. 

I&#8217;d pre-registered for a Valentine&#8217;s Day 5K so I asked my physical therapist if it&#8217;d be ok for me to try to run. He gave me a conditional 5K &#8211; if I hurt, I had to stop. And what did I do? I set a big PR, the first of many for the year. Undertrained (in terms of mileage) by any standards, but my newfound strength and conditioning more than compensated. 

In March I got hurt playing derby (the second time in three months when I told myself that perhaps I needed to make a choice between running and derby), and had to stop running again. I kept up with the strength training, and did some biking. I did a half-dozen sessions with a personal trainer who had me focus on power: the first time she wanted me to do box jumps, I was too afraid to even try. Now I am confident in my strength and power.

In May came another big PR, this time at the 10K distance. In August I set a personal course record at Pikes Peak, again with incredibly low mileage. And I even did it the day AFTER the Ascent! But I was lifting and skating and frankly overall in the best shape of my life. 

I quit skating in September, choosing to focus on strength training and running. I set a huge half marathon PR in October-my pace was actually faster than the 10K I ran in May. I actually followed a training plan for this half, but I still feel that my overall fitness is really the reason the gains I&#8217;ve seen. 

The race in January was a big blow to the ole ego, bu ultimately I&#8217;m very thankful for it. It forced me to be recognize areas in need of improvement, and ultimately I&#8217;ve found that I really enjoy HIT workouts. I&#8217;ve seen more improvement in this year than, honestly, the whole rest of my running career. And I feel I have many more great races to come!
