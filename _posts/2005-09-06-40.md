So my Steamtown buddy Bob mentioned that he lives ~3 miles from the track, so he runs to it to do his speed workout. So I used that handy gmap Pedometer, and lo and behold, I&#8217;m about 3.1 miles from Arcadia. So I ran to and from the track today for my warmup and cooldown.

_VO2 max 8 mi w/ 5 x 600 m @ 5K race pace (7:04); jog 90 sec between_

200m: :52/ :53  
600m: 2:38

warm-up: 28:02 (~3.1)

cool-down: 26:45 (~3.1)

It didn&#8217;t take long for me to notice that I obviously wasn&#8217;t measuring the track correctly. The middle 200m was consistently shorter. Ah well, I&#8217;m going to assume I ran long! I also jogged 200m between each 600, but it took me less than 90 sec each time (perhaps since it was short?)  
My legs were a little tired, but I finished strong! Just hope the 11 miler tomorrow morning isn&#8217;t too rough..
