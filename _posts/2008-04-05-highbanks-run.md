Today I met the gang out at Highbanks. It was really humid out, I had to wipe off the windows of my car to drive. I don&#8217;t know if that had an impact, but today seemed to be a challenging workout. It&#8217;s also been quite awhile since I ran with the gang, so I may not be used to running and chatting at the same time.

We had a good turnout, and I ran with Meredith and Doug. Doug had already done one loop, and Meredith was only doing one since she&#8217;s running the Athens half tomorrow. I have my final paper of my grad program due tomorrow, so I had plenty on my mind, and only ran one loop.

We generally consider &#8220;the highbanks effect&#8221; when we run: the course offers an ascent of 1389ft and a descent of 1445ft over the 5.64 miles. Often we consider the loop to be 6 miles, just to account for the extra effort the hills require.

Mile 1: 8:56pace, avgHR 163, maxHR 178  
Mile 2: 8:37pace, avgHR 172, maxHR 181  
Mile 3: 8:36pace, avgHR 169, maxHR 182  
Mile 4: 8:14pace, avgHR 174, maxHR 180  
Mile 5: 9:07pace, avgHR 179, maxHR 186  
0.64: 8:19pace, avgHR 179, maxHR 184

When we finished (48:49), Meredith and I were both happily surprised at the pace. Often we turn a loop in 50 or 51 min. So that may also have contributed to why it felt a bit larder than usual ðŸ™‚

We had plenty to talk about on the run: most importantly, how we were all getting to Boston. Last night Skybus Airlines announced it was ceasing all flights, starting today. That left 6 or 8 of us needing to secure new flights. I&#8217;ve already secured other arrangements, but what a pain!
