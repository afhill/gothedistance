Went back up to Pikes peak today to get some altitude training in. Although I didnt feel as fast as last weekend, I felt more comfortable, which is a big deal! 

This week was pretty intense for the ole legs. I started going to Orange Theory Fitness so I did a lot of incline work on the treadmill, as well as some speed. 

On Saturday I met some friends to run around town, and my feet just hurt! Afterwards my hamstrings were killing me, but then I realized that I&#8217;d been hitting them pretty hard:

Thurs am: OTF with 20 min on the treadmill, up to 11% incline  
Thurs pm: 5 miles around the neighborhood  
Fri am: OTF with 27 min on the treadmill, all of it at 3% incline but some of it super fast!  
Sat am: 10 miles???

So I cut myself some slack. Sat I made sure to roll the legs out and wear my compression calf sleeves to sleep in (It&#8217;s probably mostly psychological, but I&#8217;ll take what I can get!)

On Sunday Erin and I went up to the top of Pikes Peak and I went a bit further than last week: 3 down-and-up, then 1 down-and-up. I didnt take much of a break between, either. The downs at the top weren&#8217;t fast because I was worried about the soreness I&#8217;d had the day before, but honestly I feel better now than I did yesterday.

In all, I&#8217;ve run around 29 miles since Wednesday, so I&#8217;m pretty happy with myself. Getting back to it! (As ever, a little too late to do awesome at Pikes Peak, but better than nothing!)

New York City Marathon training officially starts tomorrow, though I may give myself a recovery day to start the week. ðŸ™‚ It felt good to be sore from training as I know that&#8217;s just me getting stronger. Again, it&#8217;s not my knee that seems to be my limiting factor, so I have a lot of optimism for what the rest of the year holds ðŸ™‚
