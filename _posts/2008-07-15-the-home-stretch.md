Wow, hard to believe the Buckeye Trail 50K is this weekend! I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m nervous, but also excited. I know I haven&#8217;t done the distance in preparation that I could have, but I keep telling myself that this will make me fresh!

Had a great run with [Mike K](http://krotscheck.net) yesterday morning. We&#8217;re practically neighbours and the RI:Running group is all but disbanded with his heat, so we met at 6:30am. It was a great run, I think I&#8217;m also more energetic in the morning and we polished off an 8:15 pace (he ran 5miles, I ran 6).

Today I left the house and decided that 10 miles was a good distance. However, I then realized that that may not be smart, given the distance I have to run on Saturday. I should be tapering, right? So I did an easy three and called it a day. 

I know I&#8217;ll enjoy this weekend. It&#8217;ll be great to do another road trip with Helen &#8212; I think our last one was the 7 hour drive out to <ahref="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2007/10/steamtown-take-2/">Steamtown</a>. And I know this isn&#8217;t a road race where I&#8217;m going to feel pressured to push it hard the whole way. I think it&#8217;ll just be a great excuse to enjoy the outdoors (for a long, long time&#8230;.)

And then I know I need to set out my goals for the fall. I need to pull together a training plan. So far I&#8217;m going between a Pfitz plan targeting the Columbus full or trying to pull things together for a really strong half. I know the half would be harder for me, but it could push me through to that next level. Of course, the longer I put off deciding, the less time I&#8217;ll actually have to train.. :-/
