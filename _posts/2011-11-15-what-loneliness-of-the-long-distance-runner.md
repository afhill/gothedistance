That means it&#8217;s 9 months til the Pikes Peak races. I told myself that I want to definitely train with the club more than I did this past year. 

However, I&#8217;ve been flirting with some other running clubs as well &#8211; [City Park Running Club](http://www.facebook.com/cityparkrunningclub) one Tuesday morning, the [Highland Tap and Burger Run Club](http://www.facebook.com/groups/HTBrunclub/) Wednesday nights, and of course the [Running Republic of Boulder](http://runningrepublic.com/) Tuesdays and Saturdays. I&#8217;m so excited to finally be getting out there and meeting other runners. There are SO many clubs to check out, I may consider checking out the [Denver Trail Runners](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Denver-Trail-Runners/124728809715) or the [Irish Snug Running Club](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=20984621475&v=wall) some random Thursday as well. 

So far I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m &#8220;in&#8221; the Incline Club and the HTB Run Club, and working on joining the Running Republic. The rest will likely be on a random drop-in basis. But how fun to think that I never really have to run alone if I don&#8217;t want!
