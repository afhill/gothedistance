    From Saturday night. As impressive as my arm may seem, I continued my streak of NEVER EVER WINNING at arm wrestling.
  </p>
</div>Last night as I headed off to bed, I turned off my alarm and told myself to get the sleep I needed. I pulled in my 8 hours, which is pretty remarkable for me: generally I rise at 6:30 no matter what. I called in sick to work to try to recover from this achiness and fatigue that&#8217;s set in since the weekend. 

#### Food

  * scrambled egg whites with spinach, mushrooms and tomato on a sprouted 7-grain English muffin
  * fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice
  * [green lentils and tomato quinoa](http://www.grouprecipes.com/59022/green-lentils-and-tomato-quinoa.html) &#8211; I used [MM Local](http://mmlocalfoods.com/our-products/) tomatoes with basil, which was a bit of a waste as they&#8217;re so good on their own.
  * 2 bananas
  * spicy avocado salmon sushi
  * watermelon
  * bolthouse green goodness smoothie
  * [Vega Sport Optimizer](http://myvega.com/products/vega-sport-performance-optimizer/features-benefits)
  * 2 sweet potato cinnamon brownies that one of our new NSOs made, knowing my &#8221;eat clean&#8221; requirements (not sure of the specific recipe, let&#8217;s say [this one for reference?](http://www.food.com/recipe/sweet-potato-cinnamon-brownies-385946) &#8211; no icing for me) Believe me, I debated long and hard if cocoa powder was ok. I think I&#8217;ve seen it in enough eat clean recipes to give it a thumbs up.
  * [Carrot bread](http://www.cleaneatingmag.com/Recipes/Recipe/Carrot-Bread-with-Apple-Glaze.aspx) she also made &#8211; I didn&#8217;t have any glaze
  * shake and go smoothie

So one thing I&#8217;ve been thinking about is my sports beverage consumption. I&#8217;m not drinking gatorade, cytomax or anything else. For a few bouts I&#8217;ve tried coconut water (from a dehydrated powder) but I&#8217;m not really sure it&#8217;s doing much. So today I tried taking some Vega Optimizer at the beginning of scrimmage. As I told Keys, it tastes &#8220;plant-based&#8221; but it&#8217;s something beyond just water (and HFCS-sweetened water!) I know I need to do some fine-tuning on making sure I&#8217;m getting what I need to stay strong during physical activity, and particularly afterwards for recovery! Starting with creatine has actually been good in having me be conscious of having something right after. And if it can be a beverage (like the shake n go smoothie) instead of something solid, even better! 

#### Exercise

  * Assisted pullups 3&#215;10 (2 plates below big weight) could only get 6 last rep
  * Seated pec/rear delt 3&#215;10 (40lbs)
  * Back extensions 2&#215;15 (25lbs)
  * Lateral jumps 2&#215;50
  * Narrow grip lat pulldowns 3&#215;10 (62.5lbs)
  * Wide grip lat pulldowns 3&#215;10 (62.5lbs)
  * Tricep one-arm pushdowns 3&#215;10 (20lbs-seemed easy)
  * Rope Rows 3&#215;10 (50lbs). Felt like it was hitting a lot!
  * Wide grip lat pulldowns behind my shoulders 3&#215;15 (37.5lbs)
  * Unilateral lat 3&#215;10 (75lbs, had to drop to 60 after the first set and still couldn&#8217;t finish the last)
  * Bent over smith machine row 4&#215;6-8 (50lbs+15lb bar)
  * PT exercises for my hips and glutes
  * 2hrs scrimmage, 1hr MHC practice

I definitely feel better after sleeping and eating a fair bit today. I also worked on my IT-band and did some good stretching. And, honestly, I think cleaning my bearings and rotating my wheels also helped me on the track tonight! While there is still some hesitation there and my explosiveness and lateral movement isn&#8217;t where it was before my PCL tear, I think that&#8217;s to be expected and I&#8217;m feeling good about getting back to where I need to be soon!
