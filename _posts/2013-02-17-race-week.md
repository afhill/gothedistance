Yes, if you only follow my blog you may think I&#8217;ve stopped running and started focusing more on eating right, but that wouldn&#8217;t be the case! It&#8217;s race week again and I&#8217;m excited to say I&#8217;m feeling great and looking forward to it!

Right after [RnRAZ](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2013/01/rock-and-roll-arizona-2013-half-marathon/ "Rock and Roll Arizona 2013 Half Marathon") I ended up getting sick, but since I&#8217;d met my goal I was okay with it.. I was excited for what I&#8217;d accomplished, but also eager to see what more I could do. 

Before RnRAZ I was struggling with a sore hip, but it seems to be all but resolved now. Right after the race I set myself a foam-roll-and-lacrosse-ball nightly goal, although I probably am only doing it 5x/week now: 

  * 4 min foam roll per leg
  * 2 min lacrosse ball glutes
  * 3 min lacrosse ball hips

I DO have a massage appointment with [Geoff](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2013/01/you-have-a-rather-large-psoas/ "You have a rather large psoasâ€¦.") on Wednesday and an appointment with Richey on Friday to get Rock-taped, but in general I&#8217;m feeling strong! I ran 55 miles last week and ended up just shy of 50 this week (UGH! If I&#8217;d have known how close, I&#8217;d have run the extra .84 miles!) I am feeling great about running, although I know I need to cut back this week so I&#8217;m fresh on the start line.

Two weeks ago I wasn&#8217;t sure this &#8220;five weeks between races&#8221; was a good idea, because I was feeling like I was just coming off the last race and wasn&#8217;t hungry enough for this one. (Thankfully, I felt like i recovered right away so that wasn&#8217;t an issue). But having Jay set out a few &#8220;race-prep-specific&#8221; workouts helped to get me mentally in the game. 

We&#8217;ve started working with a [medicine ball for part of our GSM (General Strength and Mobility) work](www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT1UnwkCxQA), which I&#8217;m excited about. Mostly because it meant I had to invest in a med ball! Although I love all the running I&#8217;m doing, I do miss doing strength training and I really want to try to start getting back into that more than just the twice a week I do it with the group. It&#8217;s all just a matter of time. I also told myself last week I want to make it to yoga twice a week.. and then haven&#8217;t gone at all this week. I suppose I should reflect on a quote I came across last week: 

> There&#8217;s a difference between interest and commitment. When you&#8217;re interested in doing something, you do it only when circumstance permit. When you&#8217;re committed to something, you accept no excuses, only results.  
>  
> &#8211;Kenneth H. Blanchard

I&#8217;m not quite at the stage of commitment yet for this stuff. And that&#8217;s ok. I have a lot of commitments I feel I need to fulfill. Intentions are good enough for now in that respect! My primary focus is on getting in some quality running workouts (but supplementing with a little strength work to stay healthy and strong). I&#8217;m definitely committed to that!
