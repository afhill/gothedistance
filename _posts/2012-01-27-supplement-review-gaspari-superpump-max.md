I recently decided to delve into the realm of supplementation to help with my weight lifting. After reading some reviews online, I went with the [Gaspari SuperPump Max](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/gn/superpump-max.html) for a pre-workout booster. 

According to the package, it &#8220;promotes skin tearing muscle pumps and explosive workouts&#8221;. Um, good?

I got the grape flavor, which tasted fine. Since I primarily use Vega products, I was worried this would taste too sweet but it was actually pretty good. I started with one scoop this morning en route to the gym. By the time I got there, I was ready to go. I felt like I was walking just a tiny bit quicker to go work out! (How much of this was placebo remains to be seen). I chatted a bit with a woman in the locker room, and felt the stimulants kicking in as I was a bit more bubbly than normal. 

So&#8230; a few reviews referred to this product (and its predecessor the SuperPump 250) as &#8220;SuperDump&#8221; for its.. cleansing properties. Sure enough, I had to use the restroom before I even hit the weights, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad. 

I went straight to the bench press, loaded up 85 lbs (which I pretty well never bench) and ripped off 2&#215;5. Wow.. ok, I like this stuff. I wasn&#8217;t really sure what the reviews meant when they mentioned that this product gives &#8220;great pumps&#8221;, but I felt my arms getting warm as blood flowed to them. Felt great! I lowered the weight and kept lifting. 

_Note: afterwards, I found a few articles about &#8220;the pump&#8221; on bodybuilding.com. They read pretty dry, but if you&#8217;re curious, [here you go](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson161.htm)_

I did something weird on one of the lifts where I sorta recruited my left shoulder, which hurt so I stopped. Then I went over to do chest flyes, which I sorta hate. Here too I didn&#8217;t hesitate as I grabbed heavier weight than I&#8217;ve done before and set to work. No problem. I felt like I had energy to spare and I needed to expend it. 

I also worked my triceps to sheer exhaustion: I wanted to do some more chest flyes and my triceps would NOT help me bring the weights up. What?

They FELT bigger! It was definitely a muscle fatigue and not a lack of energy that made me end my workout for the day. 

Back at home, the SuperDump properties came into play again. No cramps though, so I can deal with it.

I&#8217;m excited with this product. I don&#8217;t know if I want to use it all the time because I don&#8217;t want to get used to it (and it has evil sucralose), but I definitely believe it made a difference in my workout this morning.
