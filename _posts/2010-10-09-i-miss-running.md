Which may be a funny statement when it&#8217;s a self-imposed exile. But there it is.

Today I did a nice 6 miler with a few girls (as part of a group run), which really does seem to me the way Saturdays were meant to be spent. And hearing them talk about training (they do triathlons) made me hunger to train. Honestly, it started a bit before that: earlier in the week I bought [Fast Track: Training and Nutrition Secrets from America&#8217;s Top Female Runner](http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Track-Training-Nutrition-Americas/dp/1594860130). I was back at Barnes and Noble today pouring over different training books. But let&#8217;s be honest: training is a lot more than reading. 

For weeks &#8211; months? &#8211; now, I have roller derby practices or meetings 4 nights a week. Sometimes they&#8217;re 6:30-8:30pm, other times they&#8217;re 8:30-10:30. Those 10:30 nights I don&#8217;t get home til almost 11 and it&#8217;s a long time until I can settle down enough to go to sleep. Getting up early to run the next morning simply doesn&#8217;t seem to be an option. I don&#8217;t have a gym or showers at work, so lunchtime runs aren&#8217;t really feasible (arguably a short easy run could be done, if I was ok with a sponge bath and hiding in my office afterwards). 

I don&#8217;t understand how I did it when I had a 100 mile commute and was going to grad school. But I did. So maybe it is shifting priorities, or age and a need for sleep catching up with me&#8230;. 

but it doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t miss it.
