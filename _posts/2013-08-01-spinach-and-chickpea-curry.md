So I have a few staple ingredients always around the house. Spinach, coconut milk and chickpeas are three of them. Tonight I mixed it up slightly with this [curry recipe](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/recipe?id=11212204). 

DEAD EASY!

1 can chickpeas  
1 can crushed tomatoes  
3 cups spinach  
1 can coconut milk  
3 cloves garlic  
5 cloves  
1.5 tsp turmeric  
1.5 tsp curry powder.  
(It was supposed to have 2 potatoes, but I didn&#8217;t have any)

Put in pan. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 30 min. 

SO. SIMPLE! But tasty, too. I haven&#8217;t used a lot of tomatoes in the curries I&#8217;ve done, and it really make this nice and different.  
It could have used a touch more spice, but I definitely enjoyed it.
