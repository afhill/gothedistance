Met Mike, Meredith and Dave for our midweek run today. I planned to run 11, Mike and Meredith wanted to do 8 and Dave was thinking about 6. I arrived at the school about 4:45 so I went for a mile around the track before everyone else came. (8:19 pace)

We then set out at a nice easy pace, but as is normal when you run with Meredith, we steadily picked up the pace ðŸ™‚

10:15  
9:44  
9:57 &#8212; it started to storm so we stopped for a brief moment. Dave decided to stick with us  
9:24  
9:19  
8:35  
8:27 &#8212; storm got worse, we were heading to the underpass, while we waited for it to stop  
9:05 &#8212; I asked if anyone didnt want to do a last two miles with me. Dave figured if he ran 10 today, he could skip the 10 he had planned for Sat ðŸ™‚  
8:50  
8:33

Overall, 1:40:34 (9:08pace)  
Average heart rate: 161, Max 188.

I will admit as I started out, my left knee was a bit sore. It was better within the first half mile, however.

I feel so great &#8212; really strong, really motivated. I feel this is going to be a great year!!!
