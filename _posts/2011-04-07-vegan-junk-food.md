I&#8217;ve had this topic rolling in my head for awhile, and I&#8217;m still not going to do it justice here, but I wanted to be sure to capture it. 

When I started the TBT, I made three distinct changes to my nutrition:

  1. cut out meat (still eating fish)
  2. cut down on caffeine
  3. moved towards eating clean (unprocessed, natural food)

There are actually some conflicts in some of those guidelines. If I simply order a vegetarian meal, that doesn&#8217;t save me from cheese (or worse). Just because it doesn&#8217;t have meat in it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s health food. Today I came across a great blog post that helped articulate some of what I&#8217;ve had in mind: [Say Goodbye to Vegan Junk Food](http://veganhope.com/2011/02/08/say-goodbye-to-vegan-junk-food/).

It&#8217;s not a completely outrageous idea, that someone who chooses not to eat meat is still eating unhealthily. The choice to be a vegetarian actually seems more often related to animal cruelty than health benefits (broad generalization, I know). I had a vegetarian friend in high school who seemed to survive off french fries! Yet often we seem to jump to the notion that cutting out something that has some negatives automatically throws us to the side of healthy. Not so. 

There are a lot of pseudo-meat products out there, but guess what? They don&#8217;t satisfy #3 above. Let&#8217;s look at the ingredients of Yves Veggie Cuisine, shall we?

> Water, Isolated Soy Protein, Wheat Gluten, Expeller Pressed Canola Oil, Evaporated Cane Juice, Natural Flavor, Salt, Yeast Extract, Onion Powder, Carrageenan (From Seaweed), Garlic Powder, Wheat Starch, Beetroot Powder, Spices, Citric Acid, Vitamins & Minerals (Thiamin Hydrochloride, Cyanocobalamin, Calcium Pantothenate, Ferric Orthophosphate, Iron Oxide, Zinc Oxide, Dimagnesium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate). (from <http://fresh.amazon.com/product?asin=B000VHYMF6>

Yup, pretty sure I have no idea what a lot of that stuff is, but I don&#8217;t think it comes together naturally without some major manpower. 

Recently I&#8217;ve read a few books about eating real food and vegetarianism, and I think it&#8217;s really key to look at what you are taking in, versus not. Barring toxins, it&#8217;s really more about ensuring you&#8217;re getting the nutrients you need, rather than looking to eliminate things from your diet. 

I am half done my TBT program, but I think the food aspect is something I am really going to try to stick with, even being more diligent about trying to avoid processed food. It&#8217;s easy to grab a protein bar, but I don&#8217;t want to rely too much on stuff that comes from a factory rather than the earth. 

Making a decision to eat clean is one thing, but putting it in practice is another. Not too many people bat an eye when I say I&#8217;m vegetarian, but it gets more difficult when you ask about things like whether white flour or rice was used. Most of us don&#8217;t seem to think about what we are really eating at all. Or, don&#8217;t want to. I&#8217;m really interested in the strong response when I tell people I&#8217;ve been reading about factory farms. People don&#8217;t want to know! Which is really sad, that people will consciously choose ignorance as an excuse not to change their behavior. 

I think it&#8217;s easy to think if we find a vegetarian or vegan restaurant, it&#8217;ll be healthy. But that&#8217;s really not the case. In Tacoma last month, we ate at a funky little vegan place: The [Quickee Too](http://www.yelp.com/biz/quickie-too-tacoma). It was good, but as a review online states:

> The food at Quickie Too avoids perhaps the most common problem with typical vegan restaurants: it&#8217;s usually all health food. That&#8217;s fine, but even vegans occasionally want to eat something that&#8217;s sweet, or greasy, or slathered in barbecue sauce. The burgers at Quickie Too meet these needs&#8230;.Quickie Too also features a rotating selection of desserts, including various cakes and cookies, and shockingly silky soft-serve vegan ice cream. 

Grease, even non-animal-based, is still grease. Sugar is also non-animal-based, but not &#8216;healthy&#8217;. 

It may seem difficult to really figure out what&#8217;s okay to take in, to really determine why we&#8217;re making certain choices. I&#8217;ve heard that low-fat yogurt is lower in sugar than non-fat, so what&#8217;s the trade-off? 

I&#8217;d love to say that that&#8217;s why we have all these food options available to us, so we can choose to maximize whatever we desire. Sadly, many of the choices are really moreso about picking your poison. &#8220;In Defense of Food&#8221; mentioned how the &#8220;FDA just signed off on a new health claim for Frito-Lay chips on the grounds that eating chips fried in poly-unsaturated fats can help reduce your consumption of saturated fats&#8221;. Ridiculous. That&#8217;s like saying giving people guns will reduce deaths by stabbing. The lesser of two evils is still evil. But sadly, we believe the hyperbole we&#8217;re fed (pun semi-intended).
