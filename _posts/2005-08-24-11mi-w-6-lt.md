Went for my lactate threshold training run tonight. Felt pretty good after my day off yesterday. Even though my half-MP is 7:48, I ran at 7:36 last week, so I thought I&#8217;d aim for that again.

~2.5 miles warmup: 21:00

1: 7:37  
2: 7:14 (stopped mid-mile at a traffic light &#8211; didn&#8217;t turn on watch til through light. But a break always makes me faster after!)  
3: 7:34 (stopped at turn-around point to catch breath)  
4: 7:31  
5: 7:39  
6: 7:34  
avg: 7:31

~2.5 miles cooldown: 20:49

Almost completely even splits: 43:25 to 43:33 

I wasn&#8217;t even thinking about the fact that this weekend (Hood to Coast) is basically going to be lactate threshold running as well. Oh well!
