[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/380.gif" alt="" title="amphipod" width="117" height="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-665" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/380.gif)Today I was at the [Runner&#8217;s Roost](http://www.runnersroost.com) to register for the Turkey Trot when I decided to pick up a handheld hydration system. That&#8217;s one significant difference I&#8217;ve noticed with runners here, many more seem to carry a bottle while they run. I do have a camelbak, but I&#8217;m unlikely to wear it on regular runs. When I noticed the [Amphipod Handheld](http://www.amphipod.com/380/380.html) strap also had a pocket for a key, I decided to give it a try. 

I loaded it up with a Cytomax/water mix, and set off for my 14-16 mile long run around 3pm. According to [my target training paces](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/10/training-paces-2/), I should have been aiming for between an 8:15-9:15 overall pace. 

<!--more-->Because I&#8217;ve been a bit low on my mileage lately, I decided I wanted to shoot for the 16 miles. It was nice out, so I set out in shorts, a long-sleeved shirt, a cap and sunglasses. I headed out from the apartment towards the high line canal trail. 

M1: 8:51  
M2: 9:08  
M3: 8:52  
M4: 8:58  
M5: 8:53  
M6: 8:39

By mile 6, I was in no-man&#8217;s land on the trail. I&#8217;ve run it a few times during the week, but rarely went this far. I started playing math games in my head: 6 miles meant 10 to go, it was 37.5% done.. etc etc. As I neared the 7 mile point I knew I had the choice to turn around, to get in my 14 mile minimum. But I convinced myself to keep going. 

M7: 8:54  
M8: 8:31 &#8211; 1hr10 cumulative

At mile 8 I stopped, stretched a little, and realized it was starting to get dark. I&#8217;d taken off my sunglasses a few miles earlier, and now I knew it was a race against dusk. 

M9: 8:28  
M10: 8:34  
M11: 8:30

By this point I wasn&#8217;t even looking at my watch as the miles ticked off, I was just concentrating on making it home. In general I&#8217;m good at running negative splits on out-and-back runs, and my desire to make it home quickly helped! With every mile passed, I did the math of how much time was left based on an 8 minute and 9 minute pace. Things seem much more manageable to think &#8220;between 32-36 minutes to go!&#8221;

M12: 8:38  
M13: 8:28

The route from my apartment to the trail is 1.48 miles, and a mile of it is through a neighbourhood with no street lights. As I neared the 14.5 mile point, I told myself I had two options: if I wanted, I could walk. Otherwise, I could take a &#8220;long-cut&#8221; down the road, adding an extra half-mile but running under streetlights. I chose the latter.

M14: 8:13  
M15: 7:54  
M16: 7:47  
M16.5: 7:50pace  
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;  
cumulative time: 2:21:20 (average pace: 8:34, average HR 168, max HR 182)

For those of you doing the math, that was 1:10 for the first 8 miles, and 1:11 for the last 8.5. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if the cytomax availability helped as well; although I&#8217;m still not sure about carrying during a race, it was nice to have for the training run (without the chaffing I get from back-mounted solutions!)

The long run I missed last week was supposed to be a progression run, ending strong. Although I didn&#8217;t intend it as such, I&#8217;m glad that this run ended up that way. 

**edit:** ok, so I&#8217;m a huge dork and did end up going back to look at how the three thirds of the race went. Since I ended up running 16.5, it made for three 5.5 mile sections:

S1: 49:03 (8:55mm)  
S2: 47:17 (8:36mm)  
S3: 44:09 (8:02mm)
