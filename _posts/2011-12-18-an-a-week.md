Yup, this week gets an &#8220;A&#8221; for effort and performance! 

I posted earlier in the week about [Intensity](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/12/intensity/), how I&#8217;m doing a lot of quality workouts. They continued and I also wracked up the miles. I&#8217;m excited to see how things continue to come together. 

As a recap:  
Monday &#8211; Denver Sunrise Run with Trent and Matt &#8211; we did 5.13 miles at a 7:28pace. Also hit up the gym &#8211; did a 30 minute Mad Abs class and then a 30 minute Dirty Thirty circuit training class. 

Tuesday &#8211; Did a good [ladder workout](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/12/ladder-workout/) with the RBB. (8.6 miles)

Wednesday &#8211; easy morning run (6.7 miles), harder evening run (4 miles)

Thursday &#8211; easy 3 mile evening run, also chest, tris abs at the gym 

Friday &#8211; easy 6.45 miles in the morning

I already had some good mileage in before I hit the weekend! 

#### Saturday

We had a &#8220;PAARLAUF&#8221; workout &#8211; a pair run. The coach split us into A and B runners based on if he felt our mile repeat speed would be over or under 6:30. He said I was an &#8220;A&#8221; runner and guessed I&#8217;d run them in 6:20s. At first I balked and said I thought it&#8217;d be closer to 6:40s, and then acknowledged that for repeats with recovery, I may be closer to 6:20-6:30s. He marked out a mile loop (my garmin claims it was .98/.99) and we alternated running with our partners, like a relay. The winning team got their 2012 training dues paid for! Alas, my team didnt win but it was a good run. The first few laps I was too concerned with how others were doing but eventually fell into my own groove. 

I forgot to hit the lap button for the first mile, but after that went 6:14, 6:17, 6:26 and 6:13. I had a pretty good finishing kick most times: one guy would catch me at about .75 but in the final straight-away I was generally able to recover and catch up with him.  
It wasn&#8217;t fun at the time but I know it was a great workout. There are a few different articles out there about how [mile repeats can help your marathon time](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-263-265-13298-0,00.html). However, I&#8217;ll admit that our paces may have been off. According to the [McMillan calculator](http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/index.php/site/calculator), an optimal training pace for the mile distance is 6:48 to 6:57, though to balance it, we had more time to recover as it was the entire time your partner was running. (Pace based on a 3:20 marathon)

Later that day I went out for another easy 3.5 miles. 

#### Sunday

Long run time! I decided not to worry about my watch and just get the miles in. I carried my gel and water although I didn&#8217;t bring enough gel and ended up stopping at the gym at mile 12. I filled up my water, got an apple and bought a [VegaSport Endurance Gel](http://www.vegasport.com/products/sustain/endurance-gel). It was sweeter than I would have liked, but I did feel a bit of a pickup afterwards.  
I finished the 18 miles in 2:44, which is a 9:08 pace. This is a lot slower than my other 18 milers thus far (2:29 and 2:30). However, I&#8217;m not disappointed. This was a HUGE week for me, mileage-wise, and I also haven&#8217;t taken a day off running in over a week. 

In some schools of thought, your weekly long run should be 1:30/mile slower than your marathon goal pace. My goal pace is 7:38, so 9:08 is actually right on. McMillan&#8217;s calculator also says long runs should be done between 8:08 and 9:08. So, even though I didn&#8217;t watch my watch at all through the workout, I managed to narrow right in on an acceptable pace. I also stayed pretty consistent through the run, not fading ridiculously near the end (my last mile WAS slow, but that&#8217;s b/c I climb 70ft in the last mile)

I finished the week with 64 miles. Um, so it&#8217;s possible I&#8217;ve NEVER run over 60 miles a week, ever. And I can&#8217;t believe I did it at an average 8:44 pace! 

I will admit &#8211; I had to go someplace that was 3 miles away, and I was tempted to run it just to hit 70. But the more I thought about it, I realized my body may appreciate the break. I&#8217;m not going to gain any extra fitness through those miles, I think it&#8217;s more important for me to refuel and rehydrate to reap the benefits of what I DID do! 

So yeah, I give this week an &#8220;A&#8221;. If my pace in my long run today were a bit faster, it would probably have been an &#8220;A+&#8221; week. But I&#8217;m feeling darn good and content with how things are going. A month to Houston &#8211; about the time when I&#8217;d generally be feeling creaky and burnt out. Instead, I&#8217;m excited and eager to train and see what comes of it!
