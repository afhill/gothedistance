It was forecast to be WARM (77F) at the race start of 9am. 

[Avery Four on the Fourth](https://www.averybrewing.com/events/four-on-the-fourth-4k) is a great Independence Day run; they have a beer garden and breakfast for all runners afterwards, and if you place in your age group, you win beer! (I placed in my age group [a few years ago](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/07/four-on-the-fourth-4k-race-report/), the only other time I&#8217;ve ever run the race). A few weeks ago I&#8217;d looked up my age group from last year; 2nd place ran 17:11 and 3rd place ran 17:33. I told Sara I&#8217;d like to aim for 17:15 or so to get that beer! ðŸ™‚ That&#8217;s a 6:56 pace, although my secret goal was to try to run a 6:45 pace. 

I felt a little strange driving up to Boulder in the morning. I was telling Sara that I felt a little apprehensive seeing all the people I used to train with &#8220;when I was training more (/faster)&#8221;. 

I wore my pink ReadyTalk singlet, black lululemon shorts, flatirons hat, a calf sleeve on my right calf, injinji socks and my new brooks hyperion shoes. As we jogged out to the starting line I was a bit concerned at the heat and also my calf. I made a last minute decision to ditch my singlet and run in my sportsbra.

There were still a lot of people who lined up closer to the start than they needed to, so the first few hundred meters I was bobbing and weaving. 

The course itself was&#8230; not great. It was several loops around a business park? It was kinda neat to be able to see people several times, but I didn&#8217;t love just running in circles without having a clear sense of where the finish was!

I felt my calf a little as I ran, but definitely not too bad at all! The heat was the bigger annoyance, and the plastic cups they had at the aid station weren&#8217;t foldable so they were pretty hard to grab and drink from. 

I was wearing my heart rate monitor to try to really get a read on what my max is.. and did a pretty good job at it!

I will admit.. I pulled a &#8216;classic Andrea&#8217; and stopped to walk. In a 2.5mile race. Just a bit to get the ole heartrate down a bit and then I was off again&#8230; and pulled into the finishing corral at 17:13 (by my watch). 

Yup.. despite calf pain and a really warm day (and walking!!!), I beat my overall time goal. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that I didn&#8217;t look at my watch during the race itself, I just ran the best I could.

Mile 1: 6:35  
Mile 2: 6:57  
Mile .53: 6:55pace  
&#8212;-  
17:13 (6:48 pace)  
AvgHR: 179  
MaxHR: 190

As soon as I finished I felt kinda sick, but rallied as everyone came in. Sara had a really enjoyable run in her new Hoka Tracers, despite the heat. She&#8217;s definitely becoming a strong racer! 

We enjoyed some beer and fruit (I couldn&#8217;t stomach the idea of warm vegetarian hash) and when awards rolled around I picked out my 2 6-packs for placing 3rd in my age group! Another goal met!

I was really pleased that I placed, despite not training with all these Boulderites! It was definitely strange to look around the venue and see all these pockets of runners I know. A few years ago, plenty of us were training together and we&#8217;ve all sorta splintered. I felt nostalgic about it, but it also was a bit of a relief that it wasn&#8217;t just I who had moved on. Sure we all share running as a passion, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there is only one way for that to manifest itself and anyone who is different is &#8216;lesser-than&#8217;. 

And the best part? Hours later, my calf feels fine! Better than it has in days, despite the hard run. Sara wondered if perhaps the heat loosened it up? I don&#8217;t know about that, but I&#8217;m grateful for it! 

Today was fun, and now I have that max heart rate I can use to calculate training zones. Even though I felt a little sickly earlier today (hard running and beer in the sun does that to me ðŸ˜‰ ) I&#8217;m feeling good now and excited for the next race! Which is good, because we have 2 over the next three weeks&#8230;
