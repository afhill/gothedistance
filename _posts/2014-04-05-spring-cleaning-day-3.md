I&#8217;m in the swing of things now, feeling good about staying away from eating crud. I had a craving for French fries and as I pointed out to Frida, that isn&#8217;t officially off-limits but I knew it&#8217;s not exactly good for me. 

My workout this morning was good &#8211; I went to the pool in the hotel and remembered how great I feel after I swim (even though I&#8217;m still not good &#8211; my kicking is weird). Then I lifted for a bit &#8211; my goal is to really work on my triceps (and shoulders to a lesser extent).
