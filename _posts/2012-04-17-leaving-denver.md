I put in my deposit the other day and will be leaving Denver around the first of June. 

A few folks I&#8217;ve told have questioned didn&#8217;t I just move? It was over a year ago, which was roughly how frequently I moved when I was in Ohio. What can I say, I&#8217;m never content with inertia (this is why I should never buy a house again!!)

I&#8217;m a bit bummed, as I have made some good friends here, I have a wealth of groupons to use up, and come on, it&#8217;s Denver! But I&#8217;m excited about the relocation. 

Because as great as all of Colorado is, Boulder is really a wee bit more &#8220;me&#8221; than D-Town. 

Yup! I&#8217;m only moving a few miles up the road, but I&#8217;ll be closer to [school](http://leeds.colorado.edu), closer to my [my running group](http://www.runningrepublic.com), closer to mountains and more gluten-free vegan options! 

I have enjoyed starting running with the Roost Run Club on Wednesdays, though, so it&#8217;s possible I&#8217;ll do a reverse commute that day to come to D-Town, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be looking for some fun to get into on the weekends. But I&#8217;m really excited about starting a newish chapter! 

P.S. Anyone wanna buy some furnishings/housewares? I&#8217;d rather not move em&#8230; ([Pictures here](http://on.fb.me/forsale2012))
