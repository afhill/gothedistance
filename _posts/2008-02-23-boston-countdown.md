today Meredith and I were talking about training, and I realized, I don&#8217;t even know how many weeks it is til Boston! I&#8217;ve been looking at the plans I&#8217;ve used in the past and grabbing specific workouts from it, but I don&#8217;t really know how far along we are..

M-8: 02/25 &#8211; 03/02  
M-7: 03/03 &#8211; 03/09  
M-6: 03/10 &#8211; 03/16  
M-5: 03/17 &#8211; 03/23  
M-4: 03/24 &#8211; 03/30  
M-3: 03/31 &#8211; 04/06  
M-2: 04/07-04/13  
M-1: 04/14 &#8211; 04/20  
Boston: April 21

Ok, that sounds about where I thought.. so if I were Pfitzing it, I&#8217;d have had 43 miles on the schedule for this week (M-9). I had actually been planning to run 7 (or more) tomorrow, so that actually puts me right on. Even without that 16 miler today&#8230;
