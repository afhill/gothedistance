This morning I headed out for a few miles around the neighborhood. Life has been pretty crazy as of late: I have grad school two nights a week, I&#8217;m getting ready to move and I had company in town this Monday and Tuesday night (and then Thursday as well). All that adds up to way too little sleep and a moderate level of stress.

I was super happy not to have to set an alarm this morning (this week it had been set for 5:45 on Tues, Wed and Thurs). For some reason I woke up at 5:30 but went back to bed til almost 7. When I finally got up, I noticed a tickle in my throat I wasn&#8217;t happy about. Still, I had some miles to get in!

It was a bit windy and cold this morning &#8211; especially compared to the 90* from Tuesday! I had on a long sleeved shirt and capris as I headed towards Sloan&#8217;s Lake. 

I rambled along the familiar streets and felt more than a little twinge of sadness that this could well be the last run here! My belongings are starting their relocation to Boulder tomorrow and I&#8217;ll be following before the end of the month. 

I soaked in the atmosphere as I circled the lake. I spotted two families of ducks with their ducklings, as well as Canadian geese and I think even a couple pelicans?? (I&#8217;d have thought swans, but they had long bills). There were folks already out fishing (brrrr) and a few others getting in their morning exercise. 

I was glad I took the time to appreciate that this may be the last run, to really appreciate the good fortune I&#8217;ve had living so close to a great running spot. But now I&#8217;ll get to find some in Boulder!
