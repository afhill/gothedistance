So&#8230; I hurt my knee, which is why I didn&#8217;t skate tonight. Nothing too serious, the doc says I can do things up to my comfort level, but obviously contact isn&#8217;t a good idea. I was going crazy from lack of cardio so I decided to test my comfort level running. I walked uphills, but it felt so great to run!&#8230; Until I was done. Tonight my knee was achy. Ugh&#8230;

We debuted the new home team tonight, the Electrocuties. Not only do I really like our color scheme, I managed to garner more complements on my arms. Day 27, baby!

I saw today a few other TBTers not feeling like they&#8217;re seeing a ton of results. Since my goal is muscle development, I&#8217;ve really been hitting heavy weights. When I started lifting this year, I was doing the same 10-15lb weights I did a few years ago. What&#8217;s that Einstein quote? &#8220;Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&#8221; Especially since this is a 90 day program and I want to really T my TB, I&#8217;ve been trying to push hard. This past week I&#8217;ve been trying to do one super-heavy set of whatever muscle group to really tire it out to see results. Only doing a muscle group once a week and trying to be smart about recovery, I&#8217;m able to increase sets or weights nearly every time. If I can do 3&#215;15, I up the weight and make sure every workout is about a new achievement, not just maintenance.
