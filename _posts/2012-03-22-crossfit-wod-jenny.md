Today we did the &#8220;Jenny&#8221; workout. 

>   * 30 snatches
>   * 30 box jumps
>   * 10 snatches
>   * 10 box jumps

I don&#8217;t have a lot of faith in my snatch technique, so I was very conservative on the weight. Ended up with 42lbs. I managed to make the entire set unbroken, which probably means I should have gone a bit heavier but I wanted to figure out the technique. 

The girls in the group did a 20&#8243; box for the box jumps. 

I finished in 5:45, feeling ok. Pretty short workout! But then I spent some time getting pointers on how to do kipping pushups. There was a different coach, and he suggested focusing on my shoulders (whereas Leo had said it was about the hips). Once he said that, I found things came together a bit and I was able to do a few in a row. It&#8217;ll take a bit of time to get the momentum just right, but the technique is coming together! Fun! I also had fun with a big flourishing dismount that reminded me of gymnastics when I was a kid. 

We have 9 more sessions before our punchcard is used up, and I feel like I&#8217;ll miss it&#8230;
