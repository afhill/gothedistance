Food  
-Cottage cheese and pineapple pre-run  
-Honeymilk post-run  
-Tofu scramble, quinoa, potatoes  
-Strawberries and raspberries  
-Coconut water  
-Indian buffet &#8211; I skipped the rice and was happy that the saag didn&#8217;t have paneer in it. I did have naan, as I managed to convince myself that &#8220;leavened flour&#8221; is not &#8220;white flour&#8221;. This is probably not true and someone needs to call me out on this  
-Rice and bean chips  
-Sweet potato hummus  
-More cottage cheese  
-EAS protein shake post-workout  
-Banana

Exercise  
-2.5 mile recovery run. The sunset this morning was gorgeous and I needed to be outside to enjoy it.

My hamstrings and forearms were sore from yesterday but I came back for more. Today we learned how to do cleans. It was excruciating. I think I&#8217;m just not good at anything involving weights coming up at me (Some of you have heard my story of learning snatches from my trainer). Today, the bell kept smashing into my forearm until it was red and seemingly swollen. As class went on I sorta picked it up so it was manageable, but I&#8217;m definitely glad I don&#8217;t have a class scheduled for tomorrow. It actually hurts to rotate my arm. I do have incredibly scrawny wrists- it&#8217;ll be funny if I manage to bulk them up!
