Another Tuesday, another crossfit workout! 

>   1. 5-5-5 Presses
>   2. 21-15-9 of 
>       * kettlebell swings
>       * pull ups

We racked up the bar for the presses, which were supposed to be at 80% of our 1RM. Since I didn&#8217;t know what that was, I experimented with some different weight. I felt like we were standing around for awhile and then Leo said &#8220;is everyone done?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t realize we were actually DOING the workout! So I rushed to go through my 3 rounds. (60#)

Then for the second part of the workout, we were doing kettlebell swings, but we were supposed to swing all the way up over our shoulders. I was conservative on the weight (20#) b/c I didnt want to get momentum pulling me over.

Then we had pull-ups, and Leo showed us how to do kipping pull-ups. I managed a couple with ok form, but still resorted to using a band for the workout. Which is pretty awkward, so I want to try to figure out the kipping thing so I can lose the band. 

The workout went well, I cruised through the swings but the pullups were more of a challenge. A few times the band would slap me or it just made it awkward. I had to break a few times with each set. 

In all, I finished the second part of the workout in 6:17. 

Yup.. starting to enjoy crossfit for sure&#8230;
