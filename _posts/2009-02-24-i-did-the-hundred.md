The <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/" rel="nofollow">hundred pushup challenge</a>, that is!

![Hundred Pushup Challenge badge](/gothedistance/assets/images/did_the_hundred_badge.gif)This program takes you from 0 &#8211; 100 pushups in a row through 7 weeks of training. There is an introductory assessment, so I actually started at week 3. The program takes you through a series of reps with rests in between to help build up your stamina: the most I ever did in a row before today without stopping was 60, but in a single workout I did up to 180. 

I&#8217;ll admit it, after the first day I switched to &#8220;girl&#8221; pushups, where I was on my knees. I&#8217;m impressed with the results, and I am planning to &#8220;start over&#8221; next week doing real pushups.
