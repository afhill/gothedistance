This past week has been full of ups and downs in regards to my running as well as emotions, but overall I guess it&#8217;s all ok.

**Sunday:** gorgeous 12 miles at Highbanks. Great weather. UP.  
**Monday:** CT on bike  
**Tuesday:** Good speedwork. UP.  
**Wednesday:** thought I was coming down with the flu. Worried about shins/potential stress fracture? Overall felt poopy and just wanted to crawl under the covers at about 2pm. Tried to go shopping for jeans and everything looked like crap b/c of my darned legs getting bigger. DOWN.  
**Thursday:** Went to Max Sports Center to have my shin pain checked out. It&#8217;s probably just shin splints, I guess I pronate a bit on my right foot, which is odd b/c a few years back when I was fitted for shoes I didn&#8217;t pronate at all. I&#8217;m going to PT on the 22nd, but the doc isn&#8217;t too worries. Celebrated with an 8 mile run (knee started to get sore and I sorta limped the last quarter-mile).  
**Friday:** The roads were icy so I couldn&#8217;t run inside, I tried the treadmill but switching between two pairs of shoes my knee was still VERY sore. A bit nervous.  
**Saturday:** 20 miler. Overall, felt pretty good. There was some brutal wind and on the way back from campus I was dragging a little, but we had a really strong run: 2:49:xx &#8211; or about an 8:30 pace. Our last 5 miles were 8:18, 8:14, 8:14, 8:10, 7:23 (the last mile was short). Oh yeah, I got my watch on Friday, so I guess that was a little up. I felt fine after the run, a bit stiff but not too bad. The rest of the day sorta went downhill from there though.  
**Sunday:** Overall a crappy day, but I felt fine physically. I thought about running at Yellow Springs but eventually just headed home and did an easy loop around the complex. Felt totally fine, somewhat to my surprise. Still, I only did one loop so as not to push it.

**Weekly mileage:** (Mon-Sun) 34.3
