Last Friday I headed out to Antrim. Helen and I missed each other, so I headed out on my own. I ran north first, planning to still do 10 miles on my own. I hit 2.5 miles at 21:16. Whoops! That was a bit quick. I told myself to come back slower, and turned around. I was back at the lake 21:16 later. Evidently I was in a groove! At this point I still felt good, but I wasn&#8217;t sure I wanted to run for another 42 min. I ran around the lake once, then headed south. I was feeling ok and then all of a sudden, my knee started to ache. I knew that today wasn&#8217;t intended to be any sort of a &#8216;hard&#8217; run, so I turned back. I ran a good eight.

Saturday was COLD COLD COLD. Meredith didn&#8217;t show up, so I ran with Doug, Mike and Darryl. We ran north, and at one point I had to stop, wracked with coughs. WHen we got back to the lake, I decided to call in quits &#8212; actually, all four of us did. So I didn&#8217;t get in as good a run as I had hoped (had I done my planned 10 on Friday and 15.25 on Saturday, I would have hit 40 for the week).

Monday: I was out of sorts, lots going on. DIdn&#8217;t run.  
Tuesday: it was storming, threw off my daily schedule. Didn&#8217;t run.  
Today: looking at my schedule, I have meetings from now til 3, and have to leave for class by 6 at the latest. Not sure if I will run.

I had been holding out hope that I could run Boston this year, but part of Monday&#8217;s &#8220;goings-on&#8221; was determining that that&#8217;s not going to be feasible this year. Oh well, I will just run the Flying Pig, which I have talked about for years. But I think I can rationalize taking some more time off &#8216;semi-serious&#8217; training. I know I do want to get out there, though&#8230; I always feel better when I run. It just needs to get warmer and less snowy!
