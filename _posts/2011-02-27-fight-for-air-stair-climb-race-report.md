It&#8217;s a race up the tallest building in Denver, the Republic Plaza. 1098 stairs, 56 flights. Last year we had a good group of skaters participating, and I finished in 10:04. With that in mind, I had my mind firmly set on sub 10 today. 

I felt pretty confident going into the event today, if less than excited. We only had a few skaters participating, so there wasn&#8217;t the great atmosphere as last year. I wandered around on my own a bit, and eventually we lined up. I wore my heart rate monitor, because I was curious to see what it would get up to. 

Soon enough we were off and I took the stairs (walking) two at a time. That&#8217;s always been easiest on my knee, and I feel like it&#8217;s less taxing as you have fewer actual steps to take. I felt very strong and consistent the whole climb, only switching to one step at a time when occasionally passing someone. I felt strong, and as I neared the top I wanted to push a bit harder. However, the last five flights were congested and I got stuck behind someone passing the whole time. I didnt necessarily feel quite strong (or rude) enough to ask them to make a third lane, so I just followed. I hit the top feeling tired but not too beat up. Soon enough, though, the coughing started. Back when I played hockey in college (just recreational), after a game I&#8217;d cough so bad I&#8217;d lose my voice. I always thought it was some mild form of exercise-induced asthma. I&#8217;ve gotten it twice during time trials at derby as well, but it&#8217;s not common. It pitched in today, though. I joked with a fellow skater that that stuff probably shouldn&#8217;t have been in my lungs anyway!

After all the skaters finished, we headed downstairs where the danged melting pot was handing out pineapple, strawberries, marshmallows and cheesecake with dipping chocolate. I held firm and told them I wasn&#8217;t going to eat the marshmallow and cheesecake, could I just have some fruit, and they hooked me up with a tray full of fruit! (and chocolate, but I ignored its presence). I wandered some more and avoided the sugar-laden yogurt and tea. I was anxious to see the results posted, but eventually I had to head to practice (yes, I had roller derby practice afterwards). A few hours later I looked up the results and it listed me as 3rd overall female! However, because of the chip timing, when I pulled the results up again later, I&#8217;m listed as 4th (2nd in my age group). Still, not too shabby!

My posted time was 9:04, exactly a minute faster than last year. And&#8230; 4 seconds too slow to get an elite starting time for next year. Guess I know what to shoot for in 2012!
