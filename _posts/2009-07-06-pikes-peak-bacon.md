Yesterday I ran at Pikes&#8217; Peak: started at Elk Park (elevation 12,000ft), down to Barr Camp (10,000ft), then up to the summit (14,000ft). Well, ok, perhaps &#8220;ran&#8221; isn&#8217;t entirely accurate. But I traveled it to get used to the elevation. Some of the other [ICers](http://www.inclineclub.com/home.htm) were talking about some Youtube video Matt Carpenter had made about Pikes Peak Bacon. When I found it this morning, I was excited to note that the section Matt filmed was part of what I covered yesterday. (and the big rock at 5:05 is what I slipped coming down beside). 

So check it out, notice how much snow is still up there at the end of June, and try to figure out why we do these things by choice?? ðŸ™‚
