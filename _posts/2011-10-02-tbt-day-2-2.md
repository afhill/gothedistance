Well, I did it again: at the gym yesterday working my lats I managed to strain my neck and shoulders really bad. I slept poorly and felt congested upon waking. I was pretty sure this was related to my neck, b/c in the past a chiropractic adjustment has cleared it right up. However, as the day went on I&#8217;ve felt steadily worse.  
I slept in late, so my plan to get up and run a trial run for my race next weekend didn&#8217;t pan out. I couldn&#8217;t fathom running 8miles at 7:42 at noon, so I booked a massage instead to try to get this neck thing worked out. Got some relief, but still feel foggy. Considering I need to wake at 3:15 for a 6am flight for work, I called it at rest day and was in bed by 5pm (!!). Only woke for emergen-c and this here blog. 

Food  
&#8211; peanut butter and honey sandwich on Ezekiel bread  
&#8211; oj  
&#8211; strawberries  
&#8211; gatorade prime (before I backed out of running)  
&#8211; Greek yogurt with honey  
&#8211; Amazing meal with hemp milk  
&#8211; airborne  
&#8211; emergen-c

Not enough food, but even my stomach is queasy.
