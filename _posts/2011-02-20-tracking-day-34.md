I hate to admit it, but my hips were sore today. Not where my bursa is, but around my actual hip bones and glutes. I spent some good quality time with the foam roller and I hope this is just the sore of a good hard race and a decent amount of dancing, that it will clear up. My ankles were also really sore.  
Today at practice I didn&#8217;t feel as strong as I&#8217;ve mentioned in other entries. But I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s too unusual given my short sleep and hard effort yesterday. I just wanted to mention it so I can track any emerging patterns of performance improvement or hindrance.
