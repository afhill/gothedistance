So… it’s that time again. I’m embarking on another round of TBT – a 90-day [Total Body Transformation](http://facebook.com/90daytbt) program. I started it for the first time last Feb 21, and I had some very specific goals related to [strength training](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/02/goals-strength-training/), [running](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/02/goals-running/) and [nutrition](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/02/goals-nutrition/). All in all, I was quite impressed with [how it went](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/05/tbt-thoughts/). Being on the program really changed my views on nutrition permanently. Case in point? I bought myself a fancy food processor on Black Friday and asked for a Tofu Press for Christmas. Last year at this time, I ate out probably every day, including a LOT of stops at Del Taco before or after derby practice! I&#8217;m a stronger better athlete now than I&#8217;ve ever been before and I believe diet has played a major role. 

I&#8217;ve also kept up with my strength training, although not to the same intensity as I was last year, when I was sidelined from skating and running due to injury (first hip bursitis, then a PCL tear). 

So, it&#8217;s hard to set goals for this time around. But the name of the game is transformation so I need to call out some measure of success, don&#8217;t I? 

I don&#8217;t have a particular weight or body fat numeric goal, although I&#8217;d like to continue to develop more visible muscle mass.

#### Specific Fitness Goals

  * Be able to bench press 30x85lbs by the beginning of March
  * Get ab definition!
  * Learn how to do pistol squats on both legs (so far I can only do the right leg)
  * Run a sub-20 5K

#### Training

  * Average 40mpw running (through all of 2012)
  * Hit the gym at least 3x/week (Chest/triceps, back/biceps, shoulders, legs on occasion)
  * Do some form of HIIT at least 2x/week &#8211; crossfit in Jan, possibly back to Kettlebell in Feb?

#### Nutrition

I’m not too worried about keeping up with things. My rules are:

  * Basics: follow the Eat Clean Diet. No white sugar, no white flour, no white pasta, no white rice, no alcohol. One cheat day a week. 
  * Exception: I can eat what I want for dinner the night before a race (even if it means cheese or white pasta)
  * Can have alcohol up to 2x/week
  * February I will cut out all animal products – going Vegan for the month!
  * No chips. This will be a tough one! I have a bad habit of thinking things like “Food Should Taste Good” chips are acceptable
  * Avoid baking even if uses natural sweeteners like brown rice syrup, agave or honey

Also, I’m taking the next step towards being a ‘real’ vegetarian and dropping fish and seafood from my diet. For awhile I’ve felt like I only ate seafood as a concession when going to dinner with people. That’s just silly.
