The plan for the next 12 weeks. I&#8217;d say the distance is more daunting than the pace. 5 miles at 7:09? I ran a whole half-marathon at that pace! KJ has said she&#8217;d join me on some of the midweek runs, so hopefully that&#8217;ll be good for both of us (provided we can find a place to run through the winter)
