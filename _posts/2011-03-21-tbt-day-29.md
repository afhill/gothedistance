#### Exercise:

As I ease into month 2, I decided to look up some new programs and exercises on bodybuilding.com. As it was arms day, I found a [triceps workout](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/iovate1.htm) to incorporate. I also used to have a friend who did a barbell bicep workout where you did 7 reps from your arms extended straight up to half, then 7 reps of your arms contracted down to half, and then 7 reps of full extension (straight to completely contracted). That&#8217;s the first thing I did.. 

  * Biceps curl ezbar (low, high, full) (40lbs-7,7,5)(30-7,7,5)(20-7,7,7)
  * Dumbbell prone incline hammer curl (20lbs-11,6,6)
  * Palms-up wrist curls on a bench (8lbs 3&#215;15)
  * Forearm twist (8lbs 3&#215;15)
  * Concentration curl (15lbs- 10,6,4)(12-9)
  * Close grip smith machine bench press (35lbs-3&#215;15). Completed, but tough at the end
  * Close grip pushdowns (37.5lbs-7,3,4)(25-15)
  * [Flexed arm hang](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/betteru48.htm) &#8211; 45sec. Could have held longer, especially at the bottom. Arms were really shaking!
  * Lying dumbbell tricep extension (20lbs 3&#215;15)
  * Single arm reverse grip pushdowns (20lbs-10,5) The toughest part was the grip, my hand kept turning
