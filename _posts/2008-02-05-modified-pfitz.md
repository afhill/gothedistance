So I haven&#8217;t really dedicated myself to a training plan yet for Boston. I&#8217;ll be doing my Wednesday mid-week runs with Meredith, and long runs on the weekend, so those are covered. As for those tricky speedworkouts&#8230; ha, well today I set out to do a LT run. It was dreary and rainy, so I brought it inside to the dreadmill&#8230; yuck!

In the past I&#8217;ve told myself that 7:45 was a decent pace for LT runs, and then turn a 7:30pace. I decided to step it up.. and pretty quickly realized that that pace wasn&#8217;t sustainable on the @#)@# treadmill at the beginning of training ðŸ™‚ So I bargained myself into single mile repeats with a slight recovery time between them. (ok, and I jumped off after 2 miles to grab a cup of water)  
Lo and behold, by the last one, I found it significantly easier than the first. I love my quick rate of return on training ðŸ™‚
