Exercise: This morning I met Cheri, Beth, Rick and Laura for our easy run. Based on the suggested mileage Jay gave us I should probably only be doing 4 or 5 on Mondays, but I like the company! We did 7.1 miles in just over an hour. Beth lead the way, although she kept talking about how easy it was, I felt I could have gone slower ðŸ™‚ I felt great yesterday but my hips were feeling a little tight today.  
When I got home I did a tiny bit of abs, but I&#8217;m honestly still a little sore from Sat! Also, my lower biceps are REALLY sore today, a little DOMS from Saturday! 

Supplements: I figured it&#8217;s worth mentioning: I am taking [Floravital Iron and Herbs](http://www.floravital.com/) , [Barleans Blackberry Flax oil](http://www.barleans.com/omega-swirl.asp), [Extreme Endurance](https://xendurance.com/), and the [Rainbow Light Complete Multivitamin](https://www.rainbowlight.com/womens-multivitamins-complete-nutritional-system-multivitamin.aspx). I also try to have a [Vega Sports Recovery Protein](http://vegasport.com/en/recover/performance-protein) drink after hard workouts several times a week.

Beer Mile Training: I filled a beer bottle up with water to practice chugging without worrying about the alcohol aspect. Went 31.9, 30.5, 44.3 before I felt like I was going to burst&#8230; Then later in the evening I was going to actually try to chug a beer, and it frothed up and spewed everywhere within the first gulp, so I quit. Curses!
