This past week has been a little crazy with multi-sport activities:

Tuesday &#8211; PM &#8211; run, yoga  
Wednesday &#8211; AM &#8211; run, PM &#8211; derby  
Thursday &#8211; AM &#8211; run, PM &#8211; derby  
Friday &#8211; AM &#8211; yoga  
Saturday &#8211; AM &#8211; yoga, PM &#8211; a tiny bit of skating for a photo shoot  
Sunday &#8211; AM &#8211; run, PM &#8211; derby

I didn&#8217;t run Friday in anticipation of the Greenland 50K on Saturday. I woke up Saturday AM with some female issues, so forewent (is that a word? the past tense of forego?) the run. I did register for the Bolder Boulder on Saturday, not sure if that counts for anything???

And of course, my bike looks at me every time I glance into the spare bedroom. It needs a tune-up and then I anticipate some weekend rides as well..
