Just the other day I was saying to a friend that I was a bit tired of my &#8220;standard meals&#8221; at home. But going away for Christmas, I didn&#8217;t want to buy a bunch of fresh groceries that would go to waste. Then I came across this recipe, perfect!

[Ginger Peanut Tofu Salad](http://www.everydaydish.tv/recipe/ginger-peanut-tofu-salad)

At first I was a bit leery about the word &#8220;salad&#8221;, but it turned out similar to an egg salad &#8211; like a spread. This was actually the first time I haven&#8217;t baked or scrambled tofu, it was something new not to cook it. 

The ingredients are pretty basic: tofu, peanut butter, soy sauce, garlic, agave (I used brown rice syrup), sriracha sauce, grated ginger. I also put in hemp seeds, because, well, I put them in everything I can. I threw everything together, adjusted to taste and gobbled down the spread in a sandwich. I&#8217;m sure it would be good with fresh veggies as well. 

Super simple!
