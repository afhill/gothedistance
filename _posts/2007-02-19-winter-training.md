Saturday morning I woke up to a &#8220;feels like 8F&#8221; weather report and falling snow. So much for the forecast that had said it would be 28 at 8am, and the snow wouldn&#8217;t start until 11! Still, I headed out to meet the gang. As seems to be the norm, the crappiest weather brings out the largest group. 

We started at the tennis courts in Worthington and ran south. The path was mostly clear to Antrim lake (~2.5 miles) so we went back and forth a couple times. It was an easy-paced run for all, and everyone collected at the lake and the tennis courts after each leg. Arriving at the lake the first time, Mike laughed at the icicles collecting on my eyelashed, evidently I looked like I had on white mascara.

On the last leg of the 10 miles (which we finished in 1hr, 32 min &#8212; not too bad considering the weather!), my hip/hamstring/butt was sore. I assumed it was just from traipsing over the snow. Later on that day, however, it was still hurting. Even the next morning when I woke up, I felt like I needed a deep stretch (or a deep tissue massage, that would be great&#8230; mmm&#8230;.). Today it seems better, but I was thinking the ellptical or the bike may be smarter than running. We&#8217;ll see!
