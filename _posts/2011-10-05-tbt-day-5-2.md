#### Exercise

&#8211; 3 mile run. It&#8217;s taper time, so this was on the schedule &#8220;relaxed and easy 3 miles&#8221;. I can&#8217;t wait to get away from this California drizzle and humidity!  
&#8211; 50 pushups

#### Food

&#8211; banana  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; steel cut oats, raisins, cinnamon, berries  
&#8211; BIG SALAD at New Amsterdam. Seriously, no joke. This thing lived up to its name. Even after eating, I had a full to-go box!
