Today I went to a vegan cooking class: [Asian Noodles and Middle Eastern Grains](http://vegancooks.com/). The class was held in a beautiful home up in Evergreen: snow was lightly falling as I arrived and the entire ambiance was very calming. 

The instructor, Vicki, was very nice and sweet. She said that generally there were only 2-3 people in a class, but this one was quite full, with 7 of us. We sat and watched as she and her &#8216;intern&#8217; made a variety of dishes for us.

The class was the last in her Spring series, and it was explained that we&#8217;d be looking at grains and noodles that didn&#8217;t require a lot of fire, so they&#8217;d be nice as the weather got warmer. 

1) Cold ramen noodles (cilantro, tomato, sprouted lentils) with a nice marinade of brown rice vinegar, ginger, miso, roasted sesame oil and soy sauce. The intern explained the attributes of a good marinade: one fat, one acid, and salt.  
2) Buckwheat noodles  
3) Soup with bean thread noodles, veggies and tofu  
4) Deep-fried bean thread noodles  
5) Couscous with an orange marinade, red onion and toasted cashews  
6) Bulger wheat with mint, parsley, walnuts, olive oil and lemon  
7) Rice stick noodles with a coconut curry sauce, and a delicious peanut sauce (with cayenne and ginger)  
8) Stir-fry with sweet potato vermicelli

Through the demonstration there was talk of the benefits of sea salt and the importance of alkaline food. It wasn&#8217;t until the class was officially over and we all were chatting that the politics of veganism came up. The intern mentioned how he just felt this was his path, and then people started talking about Food Inc, etc. The fellow next to me is actually a meat eater, but needs to lower his cholesterol so he&#8217;s looking to learn about different food prep. I honestly didn&#8217;t even think about the food being vegan as we were preparing it: it&#8217;s not as though there were any crazy chemical substitutions for things. 

She did talk about a dessert class she does, where she makes cookies with all the different natural sweeteners to demonstrate the difference between them, and said she uses nuts instead of eggs. But there was certainly not any sense of &#8220;something missing&#8221; which I think many people associate with veganism. 

I really enjoyed the class &#8211; and the leftovers that are in my fridge right now! &#8211; and I look forward to seeing when her next series comes out. I&#8217;ll definitely go again! 

on the way home, I actually did stop at the Asian market she recommended and picked up some of the noodles we&#8217;d worked with. It really was so simple today, there is no reason not to start preparing some of this stuff myself!
