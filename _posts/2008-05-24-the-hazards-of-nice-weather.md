I set out to meet &#8216;the gang&#8217; this morning, as I do nearly every Saturday. But ah, the hazards of nice weather, the pace was a bit quicker than normal. We ran and chatted, about a variety of topics but also of &#8220;what next&#8221;. Nils and Asha are off to Hawaii in a few weeks, I&#8217;m doing the Buckeye Trail 50K and Doug seems to be considering it. There was talk of [Meredith](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/) and [Dave](notesandlines.blogspot.com/) doing the half-Ironman in July. Doug has done a few duathlons and said he look into some races for the summer. So I told him to let me know..

We finished our 7 mile loop, and most people were done for the day. We&#8217;d gone a bit faster than I expected (7:56 mm), so I decided that was enough for me. Yet, it was so nice out.. how should I spend the rest of my morning?

Well, I can never enjoy nice weather unless I&#8217;m doing something. So I packed up my bike, a change of clothes and my camelbak, and headed outta town. When I was commuting to Dayton, I&#8217;d often stop by Yellow Springs on my way home, and run either on the trails at John Bryan State Park or on the bike path. I decided to see what this bike path was like on the mode of transportation for which it was intended. 

So far I&#8217;ve only biked in town, generally on city streets with traffic lights every few minutes. The bike path was a great, fun experience. I gave the ole aerobars a try, and although I wasn&#8217;t quite &#8220;flying&#8221;, I felt pretty good! Yellow Springs has the bike path run right through it, so first I went one direction. After just shy of 7 miles, the route ran into a highway. I think there was a way to follow it a bit further and get back on the bike path, but instead I turned around, cruised through my starting point and kept going. The route was really nice because unlike a bike path in town, there were very few walkers and runners, and really only a handful of other cyclists. All in all, I rode for 21.5miles in 1:20:44, which is an average 16mph. It was actually quite different than the stopping and go-ing in the city!

Oh no, not done yet! For old times sake I had to go run the trails at John Bryan State Park. I was amused to find that after biking, I just didn&#8217;t really want to lift my legs very high! I wouldn&#8217;t say they were sore at all, it just took awhile before I managed to get back into &#8220;run&#8221; mode. I did another 5 miles on the trails, at a significantly slower pace. By this time, I was definitely ready to call it a day and grab something to eat!

I wandered back into town and picked up a fantastic sandwich, iced tea and water and enjoyed the sun for a bit. I feel great, although we&#8217;ll see if there are any physical repercussions tomorrow! Right now, however, I feel good and healthy and satisfied. There is just something about a great workout that leaves me feeling happy with the world&#8230;
