When I was doing heart rate monitor training, an easy run was 153bpm. 

This year I purchased a McMillan Custom Training Plan, and according to the training paces, an easy run for a 3:23 marathoner is between 8:15-8:45.

I&#8217;ve had some good workouts this week, so I went out to do an actual easy run today &#8211; didn&#8217;t pay attention to the watch, just got the time in (between 20-30min). I felt sluggish and slow, which may have also been related to the fact that I was slogging through mud and snow, and wearing too many layers (we got our first real snowfall last night). Still, I knew I was only there to get the miles in. 

<!--more-->As I ran, I was thinking about training and coaching. I am already altering my plan to give myself permission to take one day off per week from running. Today I gave myself permission to stick to the time, but not the documented pace of an &#8220;easy&#8221; run. My friends 

[Meredith](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/) and [Dave](http://notesandlines.blogspot.com) have personal coaches, and I know that they can ask any questions they have, to really understand why they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing. Is the 8:15-8:45 a goal pace, or a guideline? How does the fact that my heart rate is around 168 when I run an &#8220;easy&#8221; run impact the rest of my training? What are the consequences of the alterations I&#8217;m making? 

I finished running, and was surprised to see that today&#8217;s run was 22 minutes exactly. I ran 2.25 miles, and my average heart rate was -get this- 153. Last night I was re-reading my &#8220;Heart Monitor Training fof the Compleat Idiot&#8221; book and it states: &#8220;Your 70% Recovery Ceiling pace should be about two minutes per mile slower than your 85% pace.&#8221; I have no idea if this logic works backward, but if I _add_ two minutes to my recovery ceiling, I get 7:47 &#8211; which is my target marathon pace. hmm&#8230; So if I try to tie that back to heart rate training, does that mean somehow that my paces are off, that I push too hard during training, what?

I would love to have a coach to ask these questions to, to offer me guidance and advice. As much as I can read and extrapolate and hope, I do see the merits in having that other person to help you along.
