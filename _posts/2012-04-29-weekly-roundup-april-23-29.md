The week didn&#8217;t start out so well. Didn&#8217;t really end much better.

Monday: Less than a mile into my run, I got a shooting pain in my left calf. Jogged it home. 1.5miles at 9:03pace. I&#8217;d let my calves bother me for days, and finally my left one said ENOUGH. 

Tuesday: [Crossft in the morning](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/04/crosfit-wod-cleaning-up/), I wore a calf sleeve just in case. Met the group for our training run, but felt the stiffness in my calf right away. When we did our strides I felt myself changing my gait and knew running on my leg wasn&#8217;t doing me any good. Let the run after the workout, only running 2.57 miles @ 8:24. ([I blogged about my calf issues](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/04/dont-have-a-cow/)). I did stop at the gym on my way back from Boulder just to burn off some energy (and frustration). I worked on my bench press a bit. My goal for next May (2013) will be 50x70lbs. Yes, lower weight than the Pump and Run but more reps! I benched: 5x55lbs, 5x65lbs,5x75lbs, 4x85lbs, 3x85lbs, 2x(5x80lbs), 4x(10x70lbs), 7x70lbs, 25x45lbs. 

Wednesday: NOTHING. Nada. I iced and heated and compressed my leg, but I didn&#8217;t exercise at all!

Thursday: considered going to crossfit, but turned off my alarm and actually slept in til almost 9! In the evening I went to the gym. I considered doing a short run to test my leg but when I arrived at the park it started to lightening, so I took that as a sign to give myself one more day. At the gym I focused on my back and biceps, but of course I also worked on my bench press: 5x(5x70lbs), 5x(5x75lbs), 5x80lbs, 4x80lbs, 15x65lbs. 

Friday: Finally ready to try my legs out again. I did one loop around Sloan&#8217;s Lake, where it was super windy. It felt great to be running again! My leg felt a little achy by the end &#8211; interestingly enough, it was my left knee, not my calf. Did 2.5 miles at 8:43. Then a few hours later I had to go to the bank, so I decided to run there. Felt MUCH better! On the way home I decided to see how I felt to run fast &#8211; felt great! Ran 2 miles at a 7:47 pace &#8211; the first was ~8:45mm, the second was ~6:51! (granted, it was also downhill a bit) Then I was really good about rolling (foam and stick) my legs out completely. 

Saturday: [Crossfit in the morning](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/04/crossfit-saturday-30-20-10/ "Crossfit Saturday: 30-20-10!"), then in the afternoon I hammered out 4 miles at an 8:09 pace. I&#8217;d told myself to run easy, and this is what happened! 

Sunday: Cherry Creek Sneak 10 Miler in 1:10:01 (unofficial) &#8211; 7mm. Got some active release and acupuncture after. My calf at least seems fine!

Total: 23 miles this week. I&#8217;m really frustrated with how my race went. I tried scaling back on miles, but I&#8217;m not sure that helped. I need to figure this out..
