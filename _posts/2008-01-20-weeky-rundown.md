Monday: 1mi on the treadmill &#8212; &#8220;random&#8221; workout at 7:30 pace, then a toning class at the gym  
Tuesday: started out running in the neighbourhood, after 1.35 decided to make it a recovery run. total=5.75mi  
Wednesday: 2.5 around the neighbourhood  
Thursday: 30min &#8220;Learn to spin&#8221; class at the gym, then the same treadmill workout as Monday  
Friday: 1m around the neighbourhood.. turns out I have a simple route that&#8217;s exactly a mile leaving from the house  
Saturday: met the gang in the morning for a chilly 12mi, later went to Sharon Woods with S for another 4  
Sunday: 3m on the treadmill. &#8220;Random&#8221; workout, but at a slower pace (~9:30/10)

Total: 30.25m. I&#8217;ll admit that I noticed before I went to the gym that my mileage for W1 was 27.5, for W2 was 27.75, so I wanted to hit 30. It would be nice to keep it at that level going forward. I had alot of 1mile days this week because of cross-training. While that&#8217;s not a bad thing, and I think the &#8220;random&#8221; workout on the treadmill is better than nothing, I don&#8217;t want to just do the minimum daily.
