My resident manager is a runner, and today I was just going to grab my mail (in my pjs at 4:15pm&#8230;.) when he was coming in for a run. He had on Boston shorts, so I commented on them. I then asked if he&#8217;d run Boston this year, and recieved his race results booklet. He said he didn&#8217;t run this year, but had just seen a thread on that on the runnersworld forums&#8230; to which I replied &#8220;that was me!&#8221; So yeah, he&#8217;s on the forums as well, and as we talked I recalled a specific race report of his I&#8217;d read wherein he stopped partway through the Cap City Half at the apartment to retape his feet. How funny I now live in the same apartment!

Another running buddy just down the hall ðŸ™‚ He has dedication, however, he told me about how that same day he did 1.5 miles in the hallway since it was so cold out.
