Exercise:  
AM: 10 min on the bike, 30sec intervals. I did this at 3:20am so I hope my trainer doesn&#8217;t make too much noise for my downstairs neighbors  
PM Shoulders!:  
[External Rotation](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/external-rotation): 10lbs 3&#215;10  
[Front Dumbbell Raise](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/front-dumbbell-raise): 15lbs 3&#215;15. Oddly enough, I feel it on my right back, regardless which shoulder I&#8217;m working on. Weights too heavy??  
[Rear delt row](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-rear-delt-row): 20lbs 3&#215;15. I really think I was doing this wrong, but I felt it! Superset with weighted [Shoulder raises](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/shoulder-raise)  
[Cuban press](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/cuban-press): 10lbs- 10 15lbs-10 10lbs-15  
[Lying rear delt raise](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/lying-rear-delt-raise): 10lbs 3&#215;15  
[Upright barbell row](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/upright-barbell-row): 25lbsx10  
[One arm side laterals](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/one-arm-side-laterals): 10lbs 3&#215;15  
[Shoulder press](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-shoulder-press) 20lbs 15-10-5 15lbs-10

You know it&#8217;s a good shoulder workout when you need to lower your mouth to your water after, because you can&#8217;t lift your bottle that high!

Food:  
Flax carrot apple muffins  
Banana  
Pb chickpea bar  
Veggie omelet- egg whites, avocado, spinach, mushroom, rye bread (lightly buttered :-/)  
Jasmine tea  
Tofu satay  
Fresh Thai vegetarian rolls  
Coconut water  
Yerba mate tea  
Salad nicoise  
Peppermint tea  
&#8211; More tea than I&#8217;d like, but I was chilly!

Today was a challenging day! Up at 3:15 for a 6am flight. Spent all day with coworkers. After our meeting we decided to sightsee: which meant having Irish coffee at the Buena Vista (I didn&#8217;t partake), chocolate at the Ghirardelli store (I didn&#8217;t partake) and dinner at a French restaurant (I had salad and no wine üôÅ ). 

Social pressure is definitely interesting: my coworker Mallory has started eating healthy (I think she could totally TBT easily) and my boss even went uber-healthy for lunch. Great! But then when evening rolled around, I felt like a party-pooper. Not that I&#8217;d drink Irish whiskey, but I could have handled some wine with dinner! However, I&#8217;m fortunate that my colleagues are so supportive; when I did decide to buy chocolate my boss said he wouldn&#8217;t let me succumb (I assured him I was going to save it, and I will). This was my first ever salad nicoise and I actually quite enjoyed it! I really do feel great digging into a hearty salad.

I knew my 10 min on the bike wouldn&#8217;t cut it for the day, but I was pretty beat on the way back from dinner. Thankfully, I forced myself to the gym for what turned out to be a pretty good workout.
