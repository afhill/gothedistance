I&#8217;ve been tracking my nutrition for the past month+ and feel prepared to make a commitment to a plan. This is just a bit more detail regarding how I&#8217;m going to approach the next 90 days-

Although I&#8217;ve been doing it more or less for awhile, I&#8217;m going to start seriously following the Eat-Clean Diet. The principles: 

  * Eat more &#8211; eat six small meals a day
  * Eat breakfast every day, within an hour of rising
  * Eat a combination of lean protein and complex carbohydrates at each meal
  * Eat sufficient (two or three servings) of healthy fats every day
  * Drink two to three liters of water each day
  * Carry a cooler packed with Clean foods each day
  * Depend on fresh fruits and vegetables for fiber, vitamins, nutrients and enzymes
  * Adhere to proper portion sizes
  * Avoid all over-processed foods, especially white flour and sugar
  * Avoid chemically charged foods 
  * Avoid foods containing preservatives
  * Avoid artificial sugars
  * Avoid artificial foods (such as processed cheese slices)
  * Avoid saturated and trans fats
  * Avoid sugar-loaded beverages, including colas and juices
  * Avoid (or do your best to limit) alcohol intake
  * Avoid all calorie-dense foods containing little or no nutritional value
  * Avoid super-sizing your meal

Wow, throwing that out there does seem intimidating to commit to. However, the Diet is also forgiving in that it allows you a cheat meal once a week. I may stretch that to be closer to what Frida and Queen did during their 90Day Total Body Transformation program and give myself one cheat DAY a week.

Other details:  
&#8211; I&#8217;m not a big drinker, but I&#8217;ll give myself one day a week  
&#8211; Limit coffee to 1-2x/week  
&#8211; Limit sodium  
&#8211; Don&#8217;t assume &#8220;protein bars&#8221; are healthy. Lots of hidden additives and sugar!

I&#8217;m going to go back to being pescetarian. It actually works out well as I&#8217;m starting to prepare my own meals, as I don&#8217;t really care to try to prepare red meat AT ALL. The latest American Dietary Guidelines actually recommend more seafood in place of other protein sources, so I&#8217;m going to stick with that. While I am going to try to take in a lot of plant-based protein, I&#8217;m not ready to go that route 100%. 

Since one of my goals is to put on muscle and weight, I know I am going to have to pretty aggressively take in good calories. Although for the past few weeks I&#8217;ve felt like I&#8217;ve been eating constantly, apparently I need to do it more. Continuing to prepare snacks and meals and have them readily available will be essential. 

I&#8217;m going to start traveling more, which could definitely make nutrition a challenge. A few small steps will be to carry protein powder and snacks like almonds with me everywhere. 

I am also going to have to start (soon!) experimenting with different fuel sources for sport. Pretty sure Gu isn&#8217;t clean: check out this ingredient list: Malodextrin (Glucose polymer), Filtered water, Fructose, Gu amino blend (leucine, valine, histidine, isoleucine), Gu antioxidant blend (natural vitamin E and vitamin C), sodium and potassium citrate, calcium carbonate, fumaric acid, sea salt, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, citric acid, natural lemon lime flavor, Gu herbal blend (chamomile, ginger), pectin. Uh, on that note, does anyone reading this want nearly an entire box of Gu???

If I want to build muscle, I am going to really pour on the protein. I&#8217;ve actually been doing a pretty good job at that lately but it&#8217;ll certainly need to continue. 

I also need to figure out my stance on sweeteners. I know that honey is natural, but I don&#8217;t want to depend too much on anything that spikes my blood sugar too much. I need to do some more research. 

I take a lot of supplements, and will continue to do so, but I think that as I eat better, I should be able to possibly cut down (b/c they likely all have additives, etc). Right now I take:  
&#8211; hemp seed oil nearly daily  
&#8211; calcium  
&#8211; salmon oil  
&#8211; b-force  
&#8211; a one-a-day for women  
&#8211; iron  
&#8211; adrenal support  
&#8211; spirulina (about half the recommended dosage)  
&#8211; LiFiber
