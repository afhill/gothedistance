Looks like the gang has decided on Chicago for the fall. I&#8217;m excited, that&#8217;s one I&#8217;ve always wanted to run and it will be a blast if we all go. I think so far we&#8217;ve got me, Helen, Andy and Jen, Doug and his son Chris, Bridget and Brian, Meredith and Mike all looking at running. I think alot of us will get up in the PReferred Start area, and we&#8217;re looking at all trying to stay at the Congress Hotel, right off the finish line. Should be a ton of fun!
