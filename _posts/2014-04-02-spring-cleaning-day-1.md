I texted Frida the other day and said I needed to go back on the TBT. I&#8217;ve just become lazy with my diet and I don&#8217;t feel good about it. She texted me back that she and Fanny were starting a cleanse on April 2nd. 

> One month of no gluten, no dairy, no eggs, no added sugar, no caffeine (except max 2 cups of green tea a day), and water with lemon every morning.

It sounded like just what I needed (the water with lemon being the only real difference from how I know I should be eating all the time), so I said I was in!

I decided to start on April 1st and go through the month, just because it seemed neater. The trick was that I was going out of town April 1 &#8211; 4 so I&#8217;d need to be careful about planning. 

Because I really liked the accountability of the TBT, here I am. I don&#8217;t think anyone reads this regularly anyway, but it&#8217;s good for me to document. 

Day 1:  
Quinoa with almond milk, cinnamon, maca powder, ginger and a bit of raw meal protein powder  
hot water with lemon juice  
Root down tofu scramble at the airport (with arugula, potatoes and avocado)  
peanuts on the plane :-/  
Spicy Sabzi salad from [SweetGreen](http://sweetgreen.com/menu/): organic baby spinach + shredded kale with spicy quinoa, spicy broccoli, carrots, raw beets, basil, sprouts and roasted tofu; topped with a carrot chili vinaigrette and a squeeze of sriracha. I was going to order the chic-p with no pita chips but the falafel wasn&#8217;t gluten-free üôÅ

I did find myself doing something I know I&#8217;m guilty of: operating off the letter rather than the spirit of the law. They had a raspberry limeade drink with no added sugar and I nearly got it. The thing is, I normally only get water with meals, but I was tempted to this simply because it was (theoretically) allowed. That&#8217;s this silly slippery slope I know I need to watch out for. 

In all it was a good day, despite being a travel day. I was happy to see how long the line was at the restaurant, it&#8217;s exciting to see so many people wanting to have delicious healthy choices! It&#8217;s right by the hotel so I imagine I&#8217;ll go back again over the course of the week.
