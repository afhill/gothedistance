Exercise: Met Beth, Eddie, Fred, Lydia, James, Ashley and Michelle for a run up by Rollinsville. I hadn&#8217;t been up there before, it starts around 8500ft. Most of us had planned to do 10. I cued off Eddie&#8217;s run on Magnolia and wore my Hokas. My new Garmin 410 (which I am rapidly learning to hate) froze trying to find satellites so I ran blind. I was surprised we had a big group of us running together for most of the first 5 miles: James, Ashley, Michelle, Eddie and I. It actually felt pretty good, definitely MUCH better than Magnolia Rd a few weeks ago! We stopped at 5 miles (46min) to wait to regroup, then Eddie, Fred, Beth, Michelle and I headed back while the rest went on. People had talked about the return being downhill, but I had no idea! Eddie and I let loose on the way back and I felt pretty good! He&#8217;s a better runner than I, but I stayed with him until mile 9, when we hit a nice big hill. It also got us into an exposed area that was pretty sunny so I struggled to take off my jacket and tie it around me while running. I definitely slowed in the last mile, but still came in around 37min for the back. So overall ~1:23 for 10 miles at 8500ft elevation? I&#8217;ll take it!! This ended up being my highest mileage week since September (just shy of 47). My legs actually felt really good, and I think the shoes were a great choice! 

Oh, and I woke up with super sore abs from the Ab Ripper! Great feeling!
