I was so happy to have a free weekend, and wanted to make the most of it. But after yesterday&#8217;s trail run, I decided I didn&#8217;t want to run too much before the race Monday. So, this morning I hit up an 8am spinning class at the gym. In addition to the trainer encouraging us, they threw on a Global Ride DVD, so we had landmarks to gauge against as we rode. 



(It was the scenery and music, not this woman talking). I still have a love/hate relationship with spinning&#8230;

This weekend both the Bolder Creek Festival and the Bolder Boulder expo were going on, so I went to Boulder and met up with Double Easy and her boyfriend. We rode our bikes to the festival and wandered for hours! I saw the TRX on Tour guys again, and tried the challenge but could only muster up a few more Atomic pushups (I did 22 and he assisted me with 8). I WILL work my way up to 40/40 &#8211; perhaps that will be a birthday goal for myself? I also had the [KT Tape](http://www.kttape.com) guy wrap my knee &#8211; I bought some of this tape awhile but could never figure out how to make it work. After wandering and eating and wandering some more, we rode back to their house and relaxed in the hot tub for awhile (I lost one part of the KT Tape in the process üôÅ ). We had dinner at a sushi restaurant, and then I decided it was time to head back to town. I expect I&#8217;ll sleep well tonight!
