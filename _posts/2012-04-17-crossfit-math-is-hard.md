No, that&#8217;s not the day&#8217;s workout, that&#8217;s me expressing my frustration at the fact I missed doing my first &#8220;as prescribed&#8221; workout!

I was excited to see the workout:

>   * 1200m run
>   * 30 bodyweight back squats
>   * 1200m run
>   * 30 bodyweight deadlifts
>   * 400m run

I knew the bw deadlifts would be no problem, but I wasn&#8217;t sure about the squats. We worked up to them. My bar was 15lbs so I knew I needed 50 on each side to hit my weight. I tried with 22lbs on each side; fine. Then 44lbs on each side, ok. Then my morning brain failed. I had in my mind that I was only at 88lbs rather than 100, so loaded 11 more on each side, that was a bit much and I could only do about 3 unbroken. I considered dropping the 11s and adding a 5, but in my head that wasn&#8217;t hitting my bodyweight anyway, so I took off the 5 and went down to 44 on each side. 

It wasn&#8217;t until I was partway through the second run that I realized that the 11 on each side would have actually been more than my bodyweight and the 5s would have been just right!

As it was, I was the first one done in 17:37, and I KNOW I could have completed as prescribed if I&#8217;d just racked it. Dangit&#8230;
