I had the most fabulous time last weekend! I haven&#8217;t had the time yet to draft up a report, but there is definitely one coming. The Crown King Scramble was absolutely amazing, from 161 runners huddled around a fire at dusk with Betty of Betty&#8217;s Trail Rides serving up coffee heated over the fire at 6am to the occasional move to the side of the gravel path as dirt bikes and ATVs rumbled past, to my favourite rest stop ever, mile 24, where the Hash House Harriers served me up a margarita with extra salt!! 

My goal had been 8 hours, had I not stopped to take over 50 pictures and enjoyed the kind folks at the aid stations (fully stocked at 8, 16, 24, pared down at 20 and 28), I would have definitely made it in in time. As it was, I felt strong as I came in at 8:02:08. My Mom met me and ran with me the last 100 metres or so to stop in front on the Crown King Saloon (Crown King: population 63).

My feet were a bit sore, but my legs never hurt. The climb (5000 feet) never left me short of breath. I never for a moment doubted I could do it, I was in awe the whole time and had a perma-grin through the entire thing.

I don&#8217;t know why I thought I could make a voice post, as there was no cell phone service up in them there parts. I haven&#8217;t yet grabbed my photos off my camera, but I did grab a few off my phone..

Absolutely, incredibly beautiful. I would do another ultra in a minute!!!
