I submitted a request to review my results, since the mobile version of the results showed:  
Gun Start: 7:40:56  
Chip Start: 7:39:47  
(as though I had started running before the gun went off).

I got back an email, they adjusted my time, so it turns out I managed to squeak out a 5 second PR!

The times now are more in line with my watch (I knew it was 1:40:xx at the half, which is a half PR!), so I definitely feel a bit better about the race. A 5 second PR is still a PR!
