The mental response to a race is almost always the same, regardless the emotional or physical response. &#8220;how can I improve&#8221; and &#8220;what&#8217;s next&#8221;. 

I know the next long race-the Rock n Roll Arizona marathon. I also know I want to do more shorter races so I may do a few before then. I was happy with how my individual legs went but know I can do better.
