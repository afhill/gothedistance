When I decided to come visit my parents in Arizona for Thanksgiving, I immediately asked Mom if she wanted to participate in a Turkey Trot. Of course she did ðŸ™‚ So we registered for the [Mesa 10K](http://www.active.com/running/mesa-az/mesa-turkey-trot-2011).

I&#8217;ve known for awhile my 10K PR is soft &#8211; I ran 45:16 at the [2011 BolderBoulder](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/05/bolder-boulder-2011-race-report/), but I was actually faster in the [Rock and Roll Denver Half Marathon](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/10/rock-and-roll-denver-half-marathon-race-report/) in October. 

Obviously, my training has been going well and I&#8217;m feeling strong. Leading up to this race I had a few goals in mind. First, one of the qualifying standards for the [Running Republic](http://www.runningrepublic.com) is a sub-43 10K. I decided I wanted to meet the qualification time at this distance as well. My more lofty goal was a 6:45 pace, which is just shy of 42 minutes. I honestly never even considered a &#8216;safe&#8217; goal like &#8220;a PR&#8221;. 

The forecast was for the 50s at race time, I swapped out clothes a couple times before deciding on LuLuLemon shorts, my Colorado Roller Derby tank and of course my Brooks Racers and swiftwick socks. I wore a sweatshirt and pants to the start to stay warm and cozy. I felt good: I tried to assess how my legs felt. They weren&#8217;t tight but also weren&#8217;t without feeling: I took that as a sign they were primed and ready to go. We got to the race about a half hour early, so I headed off on a warm-up jog and stretch.

Soon it was time to line up, and I headed on up pretty close to the front. The hazards of runs like Turkey Trots is that you get a lot of once-a-year runners who think they should line up at the front. I thought I did a reasonable job at starting ahead of anyone wearing cotton (a tell-tale sign), but I still had to dodge a bit once we were off!

The race did a good job at offering incentives: they had a costumed turkey who would run roughly a 45min race, and if you finished ahead of him, you got a certificate. Apparently there were also sub 35 and sub 40 certificates as well. The top 3 in each age group got medals, and the top finisher per age group got a turkey! 

My last few training runs had lead me a bit leery of going out too fast and fading, so I just concentrated on keeping a comfortable yet somewhat aggressive pace. The first couple miles I just cruised along. 

M1: 6:49  
M2: 6:36  
M3: 6:52

Once I got going, I felt I was doing a pretty good steady state run. Around mile 2.5 the course brought us back through the start again, and the subtle uphill. I didn&#8217;t know the exact elevation profile of the course but I was reasonably sure it was pretty flat. 

It&#8217;s funny how these shorter distances feel. To hit 4 miles and be ~65% done! I had a couple guys pass me around mile 3 and 4 but it wasn&#8217;t the last time I&#8217;d see them (heh heh). 

M4: 6:47  
M5: 6:59

At the 5 mile marker, the clock read 8:45. I joked to the guy next to me that we&#8217;d set a new record. He asked what time I really had, I looked at my watch and it was 33:58. I reflected that I wasn&#8217;t sure I&#8217;d cover the 1.2 in 8 minutes and meet my sub-42 goal, but I still felt happy with my effort. But, it was also just over a mile to go and I felt the finish line pulling me in&#8230;

M6: 6:21  
last .2: 5:30 pace

There was a nice downhill for the last full mile and I felt great as a cruised by people I&#8217;d been chasing for awhile. The very last .2 was annoying, with a sharp turn onto a gravel road and then another sharp turn up onto a grassy knoll: you actually had to brake to stay on the course! I felt great as I powered to the finish, and was VERY pleasantly surprised to see the clock! 

Finish: 41:23  
Pace: 6:40  
AG: 3/271  
Overall Women: 10/1549  
Overall: 121/2946

I was very happy to have beat my goal, but of course I can&#8217;t help but wonder if I should have set a bit more aggressive goal and pushed harder. I know it&#8217;s good to finish strong, but I wonder if I should have pushed a bit more to see what my limits are. But, I guess that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing in training ðŸ™‚  
I have one more race this year, a 5K next weekend. My current 5K PR pace is 6:52, so 12 seconds per mile slower than today. I&#8217;ll say it now: I want to run a ~6:30 pace and break 20 minutes. It won&#8217;t be easy, but I think it&#8217;s doable.
