Today I went to [BodyLab Fitness](http://bodylabfitness.com/), which &#8220;uses innovative training cycles, personalized nutrition and accountability systems to deliver unparalleled results.&#8221;. I thought I was going for some sort of fitness assessment, but alas, it was just a sales pitch. They get you to commit to three days a week of half-hour HIT training, as well as food tracking. They encourage people to get a [bodybugg](http://www.bodybugg.com/) calorie tracker. 

Part of their spiel is that they don&#8217;t take anyone, they want people who are really committed and part of the family (even if the family is a bit militant in their demands). There is a huge aspect of accountability &#8211; whereas in other gym situations you may just be able to drop in when it&#8217;s convenient, here you have an online scheduler for your workouts. 

They have signs all over saying things like &#8220;at other gyms, your trainer only cares about you the hour you&#8217;re there, here we care about the 23 hours you&#8217;re not!&#8221; I asked about the balance of my running &#8211; how would that be taken into account re: nutrition, etc. He dismissed it pretty easily saying it was fine I was a runner, as long as I didn&#8217;t overdo it. 

In all, sure, the premise seems great if you need that structure. Track your food daily. Show up at your appointed time, three days a week. A mindless way to achieve results. But I&#8217;m just not convinced I need someone to tell me exactly what to do, all the time. Especially since I&#8217;m not sure I really liked the approach. After the sales dude asked me if I had any questions, he showed me the rate card (they don&#8217;t have memberships, they have class-packs). I thanked him and said I&#8217;d think about it. He was pretty blunt &#8220;we both know if you walk out here today without committing, you won&#8217;t be back&#8230; go ahead, prove me wrong&#8221;. 

Hmm. I like a challenge, but not that kind. 

It was slick, it was &#8220;I know better than you&#8221;. It was high pressure. And again, maybe that works for others. But I work out BECAUSE I&#8217;m self-motivated. I don&#8217;t need guilt or pressure. I want a supportive environment, where my trainer feels like part of my team and we&#8217;re working on achievements together. 

So, sales dude, I guess you&#8217;re right.
