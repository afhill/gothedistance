I am in Florida for training this week, so I have a 20 miler to run in unfamiliar territory. I found the [Ancient City Road Runners](http://www.ancientcityrr.org/) website, and emailed their club president to find out about their weekend runs. He called me back, and we are meeting Sunday morning (at 5:30&#8230;ugh!). He&#8217;ll run the whole 20 with me, and his father will accompany us on his bike so we&#8217;ll have support the whole way. Nice! Also, he invited me out with some other runners the evening before. Sweet&#8230;.
