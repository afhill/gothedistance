where&#8217;s my favourite place in France? Altogether now, Mt. St. Michel.

Look what I found: http://www.montsaintmichel-marathon.com/indexGB.html with outstanding reviews on marathonguide.com.

Come on now, how can you resist this?? You run along the bay the whole time, you can see the castle right from the start&#8230;
