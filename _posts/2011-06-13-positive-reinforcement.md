Apparently derby competition has the same effect on me as races: makes me want to do more! I finished a long weekend of skating, and turned around and attended my first league practice in months (!!) tonight. 

Also, I haven&#8217;t been the best at lifting lately but today I went to Better Bodies and the trainer I saw when I joined was working the front desk. I walked in and he said &#8220;looking good, have you lost body fat?&#8221;. It was a nice complement, albeit funny-sounding! Then while I was working out some random guy said I was ripped and started chatting to me. Guess the hard work is noticeable! 

Even though I haven&#8217;t been blogging, I&#8217;ve been doing well with food. I&#8217;m still trying to avoid cheese. 

#### Food

  * Ezekiel cereal with kefir
  * tea
  * Kung pow tofu, quinoa salad
  * pudding: peanut butter, vega whole food optimizer, banana,nf milk
  * black bean and corn pupusa
  * small square of a mint chocolate bar I&#8217;ve had since April. 
  * dried apricots

#### Exercise

  * bicep curls &#8211; I noticed it&#8217;s the very end of full extension that Im weak in, so I also did some pulses with light weights
  * tricep kickbacks
  * pullups
  * pushups with feet on bench &#8211; 2&#215;25 over the course of the workout
  * cable rope tricep pulldowns
  * 2.5 hrs derby (30 min offskates)
