I was in Denver this past week, working and trying to find a place to live! I&#8217;ve read plenty about the benefits of running at altitude, but of course the flipside is that you need to become accustomed to the thinner air in order to reap the benefits in the long run!

They say it can take up to 6 weeks to adapt. I&#8217;m moving on Oct 6th, and the Denver Marathon is Oct 19th, so I&#8217;m already anticipating a hard go at it. Yet I was just reviewing my runs I took there this week, and I feel all right about them!

On Thursday, after 2 days in Denver, I took my first outdoor run. It was 6 miles in and around the hotel area. I came across the [Greenwood Village Trail system](http://greenwoodvillage.com/documents/Maps/2007%20Trail%20Map.pdf), which was fantastic!

Splits: 10:11, 9:52, 9:24, 9:25, 9:16, 9:12.

Wow, looking back it appears I was getting acclimatized even during the run itself! The overall pace was 9:34, which is nothing outstanding but certainly not anything out of the ordinary for a general aerobic run. (to put it in perspective, my heart rate was an average 147 and my max was 166).

Yes, I decided to run the 6 miles to the complex and then run home. The run there was all right, and then I decided to take a different route home. I hadn&#8217;t gone for very far when I came across a beautiful trail. Every cross roads had a map and a distance to the next cross road. There were plenty of folks out running and walking their dogs. The path was hard-packed dirt rather than concrete. It turns out I&#8217;d come across the famed &#8220;High Line Canal Trail&#8221;, which is 58 miles of pathway! The path ran past streams and several parks. Everyone I passed was friendly, and as I ran, I decided I _had_ to live in an apartment this close to the trail!

Did I mention that I hadn&#8217;t had breakfast before heading out? After awhile I could feel the distance was long, so I started to pay more attention to exactly where I was. There were so many trails that crossed each other and looped around that I was worried about becoming disoriented. But I just needed to ask for directions once and realized I was only a few blocks from the road my hotel was on (just several miles down). I was frustrated when I realized at 11.39 miles that I&#8217;d stopped my watch awhile earlier at a water fountain, and hadn&#8217;t restarted it. 

All in all, my watch registered 14miles in 2:03:49, which is an 8:50 pace. Well heck, that&#8217;s also nothing to slouch at! I hit my highest heart rate in the first mile, and it was also one of the only miles where my pace was over 9 minutes. Evidently I do have a little something to get used to!

I don&#8217;t know how a race on 10/19 will go, but I also feel like it won&#8217;t be a complete death march. Based on the running I&#8217;ve done here so far, I&#8217;m sure it will be gorgeous!
