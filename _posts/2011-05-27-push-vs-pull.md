It may come as a surprise to some people that I&#8217;ve never really been &#8220;trained&#8221;, never had a coach. My last team sport before roller derby was softball in 6th grade. I&#8217;m naturally athletic, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve really ever learned proper form for, well, anything.

Working with a trainer has been interesting (and of course I&#8217;ve done plenty of my own reading through the TBT) to just key into the concepts of &#8220;push&#8221; vs &#8220;pull&#8221; exercises.

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Action-Sports-Images-LLC-220x300.png" alt="" title="Colorado Colfax Half-marathon" width="220" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2274" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Action-Sports-Images-LLC.png)They published the finishing photos of the Colfax half, and I was really interested to see how different the strides of Frida and I are. I see in my stride the &#8220;marathon shuffle&#8221;, barely lifting my feet. In contrast, she&#8217;s driving her knees up. And, she outkicked me.

So today I decided to focus on pulling my legs up, instead of pushing them down. Actually, as I did this I reflected on how some skaters are great jumpers, and I&#8217;m just not. Yet, I have these crazy quads&#8230; I bet I could be! But I&#8217;ve always pushed instead of pulling. As I ran today, I focused on &#8220;up&#8221; and almost immediately felt less impact on the ole legs. Hmmm&#8230;

But I&#8217;m not one to throw babies out with bathwater.. Pushing has done well for me through thousands of miles. So in the final sprint of a hilly run, I pushed&#8230; AND pulled. Like spinning, I both pushed down into the ground and pulled my knees up, and felt incredibly strong. And I finished my little run cresting a 6min pace.

So simple. But I just never knew.
