Week 5, and I missed another workout. Not completely, I just cut it short. This week was tough:

Monday: Recovery 5mi  
Tuesday: rest  
Wednesday: Medium-long 12mi  
Thursday: LT 11 w/ 6@ HMP  
Friday: Recovery 5mi  
Saturday: 18mi

After running after work on Wednesday, I felt tired and dehydrated when I got up on Thursday, so I decided to go into work early, leave early and run. Of course that never quite works out: I left work at 4:15 and hit the gym for my run. I decided to try to treadmill it, so I could set the pace and force myself to stick to it. I listened to a podcast for the first 4 miles, then switched on the new timbaland cd. I ran for about 2.5 miles at a 7:30 pace before I decided to slow it down for a half mile. I did about one more fast mile, and then I wanted to get some water. I jumped off, and then noticed the clock. I had alot to do that evening and really should be heading home. So I did. So my 11 w/ 6 @ HMP ended up being about an 8 w 3.5@HMP. Better than nothing I guess, but this was my week to break 50 miles, so I am thinking I may head out for an easy three tomorrow. The intensity won&#8217;t be the same, but I will be able to say I broke 50 ðŸ™‚

I actually enjoyed my recovery run yesterday, really felt like I was letting my legs loosen up after a hard workout the day before. But later in the afternoon I got a sore spot in the arch of my foot. It concerned me a bit, to the point where this morning when I woke up I told myself I would start my run, and bail and see a doctor if it hurt. Thankfully, it was ok. 

I am starting to get my head in the game for these runs. Heck, this is decent mileage! So yesterday I got a gatorade on the way home, and I even had an ice bath after the run today. Running for 2:41 (as I did today) is pretty significant! Next week marks the midweek of my training plan, so it&#8217;s now or never!

(Did I mention I officially signed up for Steamtown? I did ðŸ™‚ )
