Today Meredith posted her [final countdown](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/2009/04/final-countdown.html), her reflections on how the race next week is going to shake out. One thing she mentioned was holding a strong pace even through the hills. 

While I&#8217;m not going to do the same exercice (list positives, negatives and thoughts), I did decide to take a look back at previous years to assess how things have gone. 

My Boston experience in 2005 wasn&#8217;t great; [I struggled a lot](/gothedistance/2005-04-boston-marathon-race-report/) (granted, it was only my second marathon). In 2006 [it was decent](/gothedistance/2006-04-boston-marathon/), but things really fell into place in 2008. I ran [my third fastest marathon at the time (3:36:08)](/gothedistance/2008-05-boston-2008-race-report/), and things just ticked along. My average heart rate was 173, with a max of 185.

A lot of folks have asked me if they think my living at altitude will make a difference. Well, I&#8217;ve already run two marathons since moving, so really the results should be showing by now! 

In the Last Chance marathon in February, I ran a 3:35:23, in a decent effort after [barely running all month](/gothedistance/2009-02-last-chance-for-boston-marathon-race-report/). My average heart rate was 173, with a max of 187.

I started out March really strong, running every day. I faltered halfway through the month, but I have been getting my motivation back (sunshine helps!) As well, doing roller derby practice for 4 hours a week is great cross-training, too. 

I don&#8217;t have any huge goals for next Monday: between 3:30 &#8211; 3:45 would make me happy. Running sub 3:36:08 would make me REALLY happy. But if it doesn&#8217;t work out, I won&#8217;t fret. I never got any official training in place to make it happen. I&#8217;ll just be interested to see how it turns out.
