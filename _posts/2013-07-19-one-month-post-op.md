Today marked a month since my knee surgery! The time has been flying by!

While I&#8217;m non-weight-bearing, I was cleared last week to go to the pool, and I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of spinning on my bike on the trainer. It&#8217;s been nice to be able to exercise, although these past few days I&#8217;ve really been missing running. I&#8217;m not quite sure when I&#8217;ll get back to that.. hopefully before the end of August, but I&#8217;m not banking on it.

The other day I was thrilled to head out to class with my knee naked! 

Physical therapy is going well, I&#8217;m a bit bored with it since there aren&#8217;t really any great gains for me to make in our sessions until I can get to weight-bearing. However, I really enjoy visiting with Erica as I go through what I can do. 

I laugh that most physical therapists give their clients exercises to take home, mine gives me triathlon propaganda! She gave me a swim book the other day, and a stack of magazines today. Today she even told me about a training group several of her friends belong to, and suggested it may be fun for me to check it out!

Today was a bit bittersweet as my friends are off doing our annual Epic Relay. I&#8217;ve been checking in on them and I&#8217;m excited for them, but it&#8217;s definitely strange not to be there. 

Oh well&#8230; I know things are on hold now, but I&#8217;ll be back on track soon&#8230;
