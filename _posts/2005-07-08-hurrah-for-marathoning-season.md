Training &#8216;officially&#8217; starts on the 18th.. between now and then I have a 1 mile race tomorrow, and a 5K the Saturday afterwards. Because I&#8217;ve been focussing on speed (or trying to, in my &#8216;I don&#8217;t really like speedwork&#8217; way) I haven&#8217;t done a lot of distance, although last Saturday Helen and I went out for a good 12. 

I&#8217;m going to be following the Pfitzinger 55/12 schedule, which seems short to me, but hopefully it&#8217;ll work! Here&#8217;s my long runs. I&#8217;m a bit intimidated by the fact there&#8217;s only 2 20 milers planned, but overall the schedule is pretty strenuous so I think I won&#8217;t mind!
