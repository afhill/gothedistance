I&#8217;m very lucky; my mom is a runner and both my folks support my working out completely. I&#8217;m visiting them for Christmas, and unlike many of my friends who are worried about fitting in their workouts, I know that isn&#8217;t a problem.

I arrived Friday night (after a great 7mile trail run in Boulder earlier on Friday). Saturday Mom cycled while I hit up the local canal trail, but I only ran a few miles before heading home, where she and I did the 20 minute Phil Wharton Flexibility for Runners program.

Sunday morning we got up and did our respective workouts; I had a fartlek workout and she wanted to get in a decent long run in. I managed to run my paces right on, although I felt a bit sore afterwards. I tend to feel more beat up after runs here, not sure if its electrolyte-related? We treated ourselves at Starbucks afterwards, then headed home to do the 40 minute Phil Wharton video &#8211; which turned out to be an hour! Later we also did the Foot and Ankle routine.

I didn&#8217;t sleep well Sunday night, and wasn&#8217;t sure how my run would go on Monday. This time my Dad joined me on his bike for the 10 mliler. I made sure to have some Vega sports protein afterwards and awhile later realized I felt better after my run than I had before! (My knee had been stiff before, but was fine the rest of the day). I used the R8 roller and did the Foot and Ankle routine again Monday night. Mom and I went shopping and got some great hiking boots in anticipation of some planned activity later in the week..

Tuesday was Christmas, and after some family time and a little walk to test out the new hiking boots, I didn&#8217;t have much time for a run before we had to dash off to Christmas dinner with some friends. However, Jay had recommended a day off or a short 35 minute run, so that was about perfect: I did an easy 4 miles in just under 35 minutes.

HOWEVER, Mom and I (and a few of her friends) did a serious hike up the [Flat Iron](http://arizonahiking.org/component/content/article/84-superstition-and-mazatzal-wilderness/193-flat-iron-siphon-draw) that wiped me out! My boots were pretty good although they rubbed my heels a bit. I made sure to roll out my legs with the Roll Recovery R8 afterwards.

The day after the hike I was feeling a bit sluggish (mostly due to stomach issues, but some residual fatigue from the hike could have also come into play). I considered turning around at 3 miles, but gutted it out. 9 miles at 9:45mm. I was supposed to fly home on Thursday, but my flight was cancelled so I got one more warm day! (it was 60 in Mesa and 10 in Boulder)

I felt much better on my &#8220;bonus&#8221; day &#8211; my quads were getting hit with some DOMS from the hike but it didn&#8217;t seem to hinder my run. Did 12 miles, only recording my splits every 3. Went 24:44 (8:15mm), 23:38 (7:53mm), 23:22 (7:48mm), 22:07 (7:23mm). Average was 7:49 &#8211; nearly 2min per mile faster than yesterday!! I flew back to Boulder later that day. 

Saturday was cold in Boulder, and there were only a handful of us who met for our track workout. I loved it; it was a combination of 300m repeats with squats, planks, and lunges. I felt really great. We were supposed to be going 5K pace (and in fact, Jay had said he wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we wouldn&#8217;t be able to hit that due to the sheer cold), and I was consistently faster and in fact sped up through the whole workout. Maybe I still had some oxygen in my blood from AZ?? 

Saturday night I went to Colorado Springs with some friends for a birthday party, so I woke up in the morning and got in 8 miles before my friends woke up. I started to head up the trails, but it was tough! I feel as though I&#8217;ve lost some of my trail running lungs, but I know I&#8217;m seeing gains elsewhere. I ran around town a bit, which was just fine. We had planned to do the Incline, but one of the girls was feeling sick so we headed home so she could rest up. I wasn&#8217;t too upset; my legs were ready for a rest!

So overall I had a pretty great training period over the holidays! I ended the year with 2151 miles (averaging just over 40 miles per week), with 234 in December, which is my highest month of mileage EVER. Excited to see how 2013 goes!
