and my Boston training plan is posted: <a href="www.afhill.com/running/boston_pfitz.htm" title="Boston Pfitzinger Training Plan" rel="nofollow">www.afhill.com/running/boston_pfitz.htm</a>  
I put in the races I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll do, they don&#8217;t seem to impact my schedule too badly. 

As I was training in the fall, I found my tempo and speed runs not overly difficult, so I&#8217;m going to push those paces for this training session. 

Dream paces:  
&#8211;Long runs: 8:37  
&#8211;Tempo runs: 7:10 &#8211; 7:15 (up from 7:48, but I usually ran 7:30)  
&#8211;Speedwork: 6:28 (up from 7:04, but I was almost always faster)

I recognize that this may be difficult over the winter, and that Boston is a tough course so I don&#8217;t want to get discouraged if I feel like my training &#8220;doesn&#8217;t pay off&#8221;. In part that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m considering the Flying Pig three weeks later, to actually apply this training. The key race for me in the future is the Last Chance for Boston Half (Feb 26th, where I want to run 1:34:00 to get guaranteed entry into the NYC Marathon in the fall. This will be a challenge as my current PR is 1:42:05.
