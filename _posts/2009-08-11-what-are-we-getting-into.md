This weekend is the Pikes Peak marathon. While I&#8217;ve been training on the course, I don&#8217;t know what the actual event will be like. I don&#8217;t think anyone does before the try this race, considered by some to be the toughest marathon in North America.

The rough time prediction method is to take your sea-level marathon time and add a half-hour&#8230; to get your ascent time! Then add another 2/3rds of that for an estimate of your marathon finish. 

Helen and I didn&#8217;t know that when we each separately predicted a 5 hr finish time. I&#8217;ve now scaled that back to 7 hours. 

Is it really that bad? [See for yourself what happened in 2008](http://www.pikespeakmarathon.org/regstats/2009/..%5C2008%5Cppm_predict.htm). Granted, they had snow that year.. but in some cases, people exceeded their overall marathon finishing time before they even made it to the summit..
