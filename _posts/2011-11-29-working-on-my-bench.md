This morning I woke up determined to work on my bench press. I browsed for a few different plans for the pump and run, found a few articles and discussions online:

  * [LiveStrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/180701-pump-run-training/) article on Pump and Run training &#8211; four sets of six repetitions with two to three minutes&#8217; recovery between sets, two to three sessions per week for six to eight weeks.
  * Ridiculous thread on [Let&#8217;s Run](http://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=3446911&page=0) about how easy benching your bodyweight is, or how no runner can do it, with no one offering any plans to get there
  * Decent discussion on [beginner triathlete](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/discussion/forums/thread-view.asp?posts=8&tid=147050) in which one poster recommends cluster sets (not going to failure)
  * One discussion forum also linked to an article called [Up Your Bench Press 30lbs in 30 days](http://www.wannabebig.com/training/powerlifting-and-functional-strength-for-athletics/up-your-bench-press-30lbs-in-30-days/) from WannaBeBig.com. It&#8217;s actually a real plan that has you working on the supporting muscles &#8211; triceps, lats, etc. Sadly, I&#8217;ll be away from a serious gym for about 3 weeks in December so following this plan will have to wait until January. 

My friend Doug (who placed [4th in his age group at age 49](http://athlinks.com/result/3415/4295/69270564/746132)) supported my idea to train with a Smith Machine, saying that I could probably bench 20% more using a SM. Not that that&#8217;s what I wanted to hear.. I just want to get to the number I need! But I feel safer using the Smith Machine without a spotter.

Today&#8217;s workout:  
Smith machine:  
&#8211; 3x(5x65lbs) (50lbs + 15lb bar)  
&#8211; 3x(5&#215;75)  
&#8211; 3x85lbs &#8211; couldn&#8217;t finish my second set  
&#8211; 3x(10&#215;35) &#8211; figured I&#8217;d get in some endurance

Bench  
&#8211; 5x35lbs (apparently the Women&#8217;s Olympic bar is 35lbs, not 45 like in the men&#8217;s weight room)  
&#8211; 5x45lbs  
&#8211; 5&#215;55  
&#8211; 5&#215;65  
&#8211; 2&#215;75

I actually like the real bench better &#8211; it&#8217;s wider and I can plant my feet, unlike at the Smith Machine. I&#8217;m just not comfortable being aggressive without a spotter. In a crappy catch-22, I think I also get distracted or self-conscious when I do have a spotter..

I&#8217;m also going to be doing more pushups in sets of 10 throughout the day. For awhile I was doing pushups with my hands pretty close to my body, but I&#8217;ve widened my hands and will be pushing all the way down to letting my chest hit the floor. Also, started back on Creatine.

I asked my strong pixie friend Melissa what she recommended as well, so I&#8217;m going to be doing some single arm dumbbell presses (flat and incline), then work on building up. She recommended staying away from relying on the Smith Machine..

Pushups: 150 over the course of the day in sets of 10
