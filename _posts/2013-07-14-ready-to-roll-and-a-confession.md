Confession first. My long-standing joke has always been &#8220;I would do triathlons if it weren&#8217;t for the swimming and biking!&#8221; I painted myself as a one-trick pony, and as I&#8217;ve started to get ready for this new athletic endeavor, I&#8217;ve felt like I have two sports to pick up.

Except, when I start thinking about it, I&#8217;ve already done _some cycling_. I went on a few 20-30 mile rides with a co-worker back in Columbus. I had a roadbike with clip-on aerobars, and I used to watch roller derby bouts online while on the trainer. Back in 2009 when I had a work visa/driver&#8217;s licence renewal snafu, I rode my bike to work for several weeks. It&#8217;s not much by Colorado standards of course (I have two friends who did [The Triple Bypass](http://www.teamevergreen.org/sites/default/files/TripleBypass2013RouteMaps%2005.04.13.pdf) today), but I think I have to admit that I&#8217;m not a complete novice. The 50+ miles I &#8220;rode&#8221; last week probably attest to that as well (they were on the trainer with zero resistance, so not really a true test &#8211; but it&#8217;s still time in the saddle!)

Why am I mentioning this? Because I started writing this post about putting my bike on the trainer, and liking being in aero, and it occurred to me that most people probably don&#8217;t know that unless they&#8217;ve put some time on the bike before&#8230;

Yeah, so I&#8217;ve been riding my old bike (a [GT Tachyon](http://www.performancebike.com/bikes/Product_10052_10551_1114671_-1_400316__400316)) on the trainer for the past few weeks, and today I finally made the big switch! My new bike (tentatively named &#8220;Zed&#8221;), with its training wheels, clipless pedals and Cobb Gen2 saddle* are all ready to go.

_*I got the Cobb Gen2 saddle in part because Cobb has a great return policy and I wanted to give it a try. I&#8217;m not entirely sold yet &#8211; I know a few girls who ride with Adamos and I may want to try them. But I figure I need to at leas give this a fair shot first._ 

Of course, the geek in me tried to look up information related to triathlon bike fit geometry and I did the best I could, but I&#8217;m still planning to get a professional fit once my right leg is back to normal. Because I&#8217;m still officially non-weight-bearing on my right leg, I manually clipped the shoes on, and then slid my feet in and I found it&#8217;s really quite comfortable. The aggressive knee angle is more than I&#8217;m used to, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt and I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m favoring one leg over the other. 

And of course, only in Boulder &#8211; I looked up &#8220;triathlon bike fit&#8221; and the YouTube video I found features a girl I&#8217;ve run with before!
