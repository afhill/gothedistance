Today was the first day in awhile where I woke up not feeling like complete crap! I slept really well, with random dreams of Australian roller derby skaters and Vibram FiveFingers. Weird&#8230;.

Food  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; odwalla green smoothie  
&#8211; quinoa, hemp milk, hemp seed, chia seed, cinnamon.  
&#8211; probar superfood slam bar  
&#8211; butternut squash salad. Where salad means &#8220;three tiny little slices artfully arranged on a plate&#8221;  
&#8211; clif builder bar. I carried a purse today or the first time in months&#8230; and it was a good thing because mid-afternoon I was starving!I felt like a total mom, rummaging through my purse for a snack&#8230;  
&#8211; a bit of my homemade energy gel. It actually tasted great! Now to figure out how to carry it (I don&#8217;t need a whole sandwich bag full)  
&#8211; sesame tofu with brown rice  
&#8211; dulse  
&#8211; guacamole and blue corn chips

Exercise  
&#8211; 5.6 mile run. I don&#8217;t know who I&#8217;m kidding- Long runs can&#8217;t happen on a tenth-of-a-mile track.
