The hotel gym was one of the nicest I&#8217;ve seen! Had bosu, medicine balls and foam rollers as well as quite a bit of equipment. Since I ran tues/wed/thurs I&#8217;d decided not to run, which was a shame as it was actually very sunny and pretty out. 

Unintentional cheat day- went for a work breakfast and noticed &#8220;coffee milk&#8221; in the cooler. My coworkers said it was a New England thing so I wanted to try it&#8230;. It had HFCS! Not sure the last time I had that üôÅ then my boss ordered in pizza for lunch&#8230; Cheat day it is! I decided to treat myself to Starbucks and tried to give a free holiday drink to the guy behind me in line, he declined. Apparently the cheat was meant to be as I had to dash through the airport to catch my connection, and therefore was resigned to plane food.
