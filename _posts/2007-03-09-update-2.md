I had been thinking about the Flying Pig, and then I realzized it was the 5th birthday of my [running buddy from the Columbus marathon](http://www.marathonfoto.com/image_server.cfm?customer_number=C81760&negs_number=36455041) this past year! Her parents have a huge cookout with games (horseshoes) and everything, so I don&#8217;t really want to miss that. 

Well, on April 28th is the Kentucky Derby Marathon, that&#8217;s about 3.5 hrs away, and it&#8217;s in another state (I think that brings me to 10&#8230; AZ, FL, IL, IN, KY, MA, MI, OH, PA, WV &#8211; yup!). So that is my latest thought. However, that brings it a week closer, so I need to get some training in place!

Potential plan:  
03/10 &#8211; 15 &#8211; 18  
03/16 &#8211; (out of town Sat &#8212; will get it in Friday) &#8211; 20?  
03/24 &#8211; Highbanks &#8211; 12-15  
03/31 &#8211; 20  
04/07 &#8211; Highbanks &#8211; 12  
04/14 &#8211; Cap City Half (13.1)  
04/21 &#8211; 10-12?  
04/28 &#8211; 26.2???
