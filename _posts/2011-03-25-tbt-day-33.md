#### Food

  * 6:00 apple
  * 7:15 pb chickpea bar
  * 8:00 smoothie: yogurt, egg whites, banana, orange, frozen berries, kale, protein powder, glutamine, chia seeds, flax seed, wheat germ
  * 11:30 brown rice with spinach, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, peas, bean sprouts
  * 2:15 Starbucks nf chai latte. I actually debated over this for awhile, then decided it doesn&#8217;t count as coffee bc I didn&#8217;t get the espresso shot
  * 3:15 light tuna with whole wheat crackers
  * 4:30 apple
  * 5:15 whole wheat/flax English muffin with pb. Dates.
  * 10:15 whole wheat sweet potato gnocchi, veggie tempeh, tomato, sugar snap peas

#### Exercise: shoulders!

  * lateral raise (15lbs 8 5 4)(12lbs 10 5)
  * Straight arm front raise (12lbs 20 10 10)
  * external rotation (20lbs 3&#215;10)
  * shoulder press pulses (50lbs 50 40 30)(40lbs 40)
  * smith machine rear delt row (50lbs 3&#215;10 )this is very similar to my back rows, not sure if I quite have the technique right
  * Cuban press with ezbar (30lbs 10 7 10)
  * reverse flyes (10lbs 10 8 10)
  * smith machine upright row (40lbs 8 4 )(20lbs 3&#215;12 ) dropping the weight makes it really easy to figure out the proper technique!

forgot my gloves today so my hands are callused üôÅ also, I miss cardio but I just can&#8217;t get into machines at the gym.
