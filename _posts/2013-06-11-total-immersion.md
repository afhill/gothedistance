So when I post things like &#8220;probably not swimming&#8221; in a blog post, that&#8217;s generally a sign that I&#8217;ve opened the door to something.. I know a friend who did a self-coached program when he got into <a name="a"></a>triathlon that seemed to work for him, so I decided to learn more about it.

[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4543" alt="Total Immersion Logo" src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TIlogo-300x162.jpg" width="300" height="162" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TIlogo.jpg)The program is called [Total Immersion](http://totalimmersion.net) and there are a TON of resources online. The program is intended to help people really become comfortable with the water and focus on flowing with the water rather than pushing against it. I was intrigued.

Sunday was my first day at the pool, and I played for about an hour getting used to having my face underwater ( I honestly think SCUBA diving ruined me: I want to be able to breathe in and out normally) and doing some of the initial drills: superman glides, superman flutter, etc. I do think that once I get the breathing down (that wasn&#8217;t covered in lesson 1), I&#8217;ll become a good little swimmer. I really liked the methodical way I moved through the water &#8211; until I had to stop and breathe. But even with a nice slow swim I can already get 25-35% of the way across the pool before I need to take a breath.

I went back this morning for a half hour, and I&#8217;m really anxious to move on and figure out this breathing thing! I do really enjoy figuring things out and tweaking them, however. The pool was pretty deserted again this morning, which is perfect for me. Although I already spent less time fiddling with my goggles and more time swimming laps than I did the other day. So far I&#8217;ve just been looking at Lesson 1 in the [Easy Freestyle](http://www.triathlonsummit.com/pdf/easy-freestyle.pdf) PDF I found online, but the official DVD is on its way and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the drills are actually broken down. I always love picking up something new, and if I can do that in an environment where I think no one is watching or judging, I&#8217;m happy to give it a try!
