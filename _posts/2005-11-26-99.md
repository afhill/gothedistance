Met Doug out at Highbanks this morning, I decided to give the ole camelbak a try on the trails. I jokingly told Doug that I was glad I could wear it with him, because I figured if I ran with it with Mike or Meredith, they&#8217;d tease me like there was no tomorrow. There was a slight sloshing sound when we started out, but I quickly got used to it. Overall, it felt ok. The hydration system, that is.

The run was a little.. ugh. I just feel sluggish. Maybe that is due in part to the fact that it&#8217;s getting colder so I was somewhat bundled up, or the fact that I did have an extra few pounds on my back, or the fact that I&#8217;ve now run ~35 miles in the past 7 days, almost as much as I&#8217;d run the previous three weeks put together. We did two laps at Highbanks (I debated doing a third, but decided not to bother &#8211; also I don&#8217;t think Doug should be doing 18 a week before he runs the Vegas Marathon next weekend!), the first was 53:xx, the second was 51:50. Both reasonably slow, but it wasn&#8217;t because I was hurting or anything. As I said, I just feel sluggish. 

It&#8217;s 6 weeks to Disney, so I really wanted to get a 20 miler in next weekend, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s smart. Or maybe I&#8217;ll break up a few runs to get the miles in.. we&#8217;ll see. I want to do decent in Disney, I just need to &#8216;break through&#8217; this slump I&#8217;m in right now.
