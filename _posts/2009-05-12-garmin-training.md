The past two days, I&#8217;ve played with my Garmin a bit to try out some different things while training. 

Yesterday I set out for a quick 20 minute run, with 4 minutes each in Heart Rate Zone 1, HRZ 2, HRZ 3, HRZ 2, HRZ 1. I jogged around the parking lot at work, but because of the need to pay attention to my heart rate, I didn&#8217;t feel overly bored by the lack of scenery (it also meant I didn&#8217;t have to try to control my heart rate over the hills around our office). Interestingly enough, I hit exactly 2.0 miles in the 20 minutes.

Today I planned to do [a workout I&#8217;d done with Meredith last year](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/09/forget-tuesdays-with-morrie/).

15 min. warmup  
3 x (3 min fast, 3 min recovery + 2 min fast, 2 min recovery + 1 min fast, 1 min recovery)  
19 min. cooldown  
————  
1hr 10 min workout

I was wearing my Newtons for the longest run so far, and they still feel &#8220;different&#8221;. When I peeled into the fast sections, I felt like I was able to turn my legs over much more quickly as my stride was smaller. Compared to my first rep from last fall, my times were pretty aggressive:

  </tr></table>

    &#8230;and then I decided that was enough.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So I headed back home in at an easy pace, and made it a ~49min / 5 mile run.

    I&#8217;m glad I got the leg turnover, and felt my lungs burn as they did. It really does make it easier to push yourself when it&#8217;s in short bursts. It wasn&#8217;t a particularly god workout, but it was a start for me to think about trying to get some speed back..
