Training is getting serious! After a hard tempo workout Thurs night and HIIT with Orange Theory Fitness on Friday morning, I met Kathryn for a 16.x mile long run Saturday.

Kathryn isn&#8217;t so good at that &#8220;your long run should be 90-120 seconds slower than race pace&#8221; stuff, and I keep getting sucked in!

We did a huge loop, and around mile 5/6 I told her we were going too fast&#8230; unfortunately I think I still paid for them in the last couple, which were really rough.

For those playing along at home, my goal for Eugene is sub 3:30, which is an 8 minute mile. A lot of running plans say that those long runs should be at least a minute per mile slow er than race pace. Let&#8217;s see how we did&#8230;

1: 9:39  
2: 8:53  
3: 8:28  
4: 8:36  
5: 8:28  
6: 8:31  
7: 8:29 &#8211; Funny, this was where I said we were going too fast&#8230;  
8: 8:14 &#8211; so what the heck is this????  
9: 8:42  
10: 8:40 &#8211; This was where we stopped for water at Union Station and regrouped  
11: 8:58  
12: 8:46  
13: 8:54  
14: 8:40  
15: 8:48  
16: 8:45  
.45: 8:59 pace  
&#8212;&#8211;  
16.45 in 2:23:36 (8:44 pace)

Ok, so looking at this I actually didn&#8217;t fall apart like I felt I did, but it sure was a LOT harder to run those last few miles! 

In the afternoon I really stretched a lot &#8211; my right knee felt surprisingly unstable (?). I&#8217;m a bit sore today but it also feels good, like I&#8217;m getting some good training in!

I just don&#8217;t want these long runs to be too aggressive so that I can&#8217;t really pour on the speed during the speed training, because I really think that&#8217;s what&#8217;ll make the difference for me in May. 

So far this week I&#8217;m up at 36 miles (over 4 days) so I&#8217;d like to grab an easy 4 today just to get up to 40. That seems like a good weekly mileage for me &#8211; although with my trips coming up it may not be sustainable. I&#8217;m really excited to see what I can do come race day!
