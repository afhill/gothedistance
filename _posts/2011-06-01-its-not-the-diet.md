My mood from yesterday hasn&#8217;t improved &#8211; in fact, today I felt anxious and angry like I haven&#8217;t in a long time. Things were upsetting me like mad, to the point where I wrote an email to my bosses apologizing for my defensiveness in some of our communications. 

My boss called me back right away and we talked, and she suggested that it was because of my crazy diet. But I&#8217;m not ON the diet anymore..! (well, officially). Honestly, though, maybe it is indirectly b/c of the diet. I had great structure and focus for three months, and I am floundering a little now. Sure, I&#8217;ve been still working out, but I don&#8217;t have a specific plan I&#8217;m following. I need to get a plan in place so I can start to feel normal again.

I will admit after that, and the email to my bosses that helped me acknowledge and then release some of my anxiety, that things got a bit better.
