  * nf chai latte (not Starbucks)
  * nf latte. My first since Jan 20, also in Berkeley. Tasted like heaven
  * mushroom soup- with popcorn?, organic greens
  * two glasses of wine

#### Exercise

None-rest day!

I debated literally for days about tonight. We were meeting a client for dinner in Napa, did I want to enjoy the wine or not? The problem stems from the fact that I really enjoy red wine, and this Saturday my roller derby team is also hosting a wine tasting. I hate to pass up on either.  
So.. I decided I would cheat on drinking twice this week. However, I will keep my food clean to make up for it :-/ I hate not to live up to the program, but these are &#8220;special events&#8221;.
