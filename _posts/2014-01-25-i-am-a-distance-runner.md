Last week I met with Runners Edge of the Rockies for the start of their Spring training session, and ran 9.5 miles (with some water breaks). Prior to that the furthest I&#8217;d run in the past 6 months was about 5, so I was pretty surprised with how I felt &#8211; my hip flexors were a little sore starting around 7.5/8 but I made it through. 

Today I met the group again and when Brian said he was doing 12, I immediately said I wouldn&#8217;t go that far. 

Uh huh. Who knows me? I did 11.5. (this means I stop at the water stop shortly before the turnaround while Brian, Deidre and D&#8217;s husband continue to the &#8216;true&#8217; turnaround). 

Faster pace, further distance, and yet I felt better than last week. I felt strong through the run, and I&#8217;m certainly less sore immediately after than I was last week. 

I feel good, simple joy. This is a core part of who I am and it feels so good to be back to that. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m running with this group where I don&#8217;t feel any pressure to hit a time goal. I&#8217;m just coming back and yet the distance is not a limiting factor. I&#8217;m really excited to see these gains and feel stronger week to week. 

I still havent committed to a target race, although given the fact I can already get through 12, it seems a bit silly not to have anything further than a 10K officially on the schedule. On the other hand, I&#8217;m enjoying the lack of pressure. Running is fun again! (and who&#8217;d have thought I&#8217;d say that when just coming back from injury???)
