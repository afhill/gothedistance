I realized the other day that it&#8217;s only 6 weeks to the Columbus Distance Classic (or whatever it&#8217;s known as now &#8212; I think it&#8217;s changed names each of the 4 years it&#8217;s been in existence). Yikes! And if I plan to run the Flying Pig, that&#8217;s only a few weeks later. Time to get serious, if I&#8217;m going to. 

So today I met Andy, Brian, Mike and Darryl at 8. It was actually pretty nice out. Everyone said they were going to run 10 (Andy and I think Brian are doing the Pump and Run tomorrow), which was shorter than I wanted to do. We set out, and overall I felt pretty good. We went north and did the 7 mile loop in about 59min. Then we went out 1.5 and back. When we were turning around, someone asked us how far we were going and how fast, our last mile had been 8:15, we were at about an overall 8:20 pace. When we got back to the lake, I told Brian I was thinking about running a few more miles. Three of the guys headed out for hot chocolate, Mike went home, and I did another 5 miles. It got steadily colder over the course of the run, and I&#8217;ll admit I was feeling ready to be done in the last mile or two, but I&#8217;m glad I did the distance. I had entertained the idea of running 16 so I could get 20 in for the week, but I was happy with the 15.
