Today was a really good training run with &#8216;the group&#8217;. I haven&#8217;t run that often this week, only Wed, Thurs and then today. We were at Highbanks, I ran one loop with Meredith (50:53), one with Doug (48:53), and then the last bottom half loop with Doug (29:25). I felt like I was pushing myself, but it felt great! 

Meredith and I were talking about how we felt in alot better shape last year at this time. My guess is because I&#8217;ve been doing these races, not really giving myself alot of time to recover and work on my speed. For example, last year around this time my longest run during the week was about 6 miles. Now, I rarely do shorter than that (for example, I ran 11.5 on Thursday &#8211; on trails). It&#8217;s easy to go faster and harder if you&#8217;re only doing 4 miles. 

So right now I feel like I actually want to get some training in, rather than just &#8216;taper &#8211; race &#8211; recover &#8211; taper &#8216;. I actually just signed up to volunteer at the Last Chance race, rather than run it. I&#8217;m actually pretty happy with myself for doing that, it makes sense to try to give back to the running community.
