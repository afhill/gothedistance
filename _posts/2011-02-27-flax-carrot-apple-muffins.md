The more I try to eat healthy, the more I&#8217;m reminded I like to bake. I haven&#8217;t done much of it in recent years b/c I don&#8217;t want to have a bunch of sweets, but I&#8217;m enjoying this healthy food prep! Today&#8217;s culinary adventure was Flax Carrot Apple muffins. As I mentioned yesterday, I&#8217;m anxious to have portable food I can take with me this weekend. I found [this recipe from Eat Clean for Families and Kids](http://blog.superhealthykids.com/2010/04/flax-carrot-apple-muffins/) and decided to give it a try! 

* 1 Â½ cup Flour  
* Â¾ cup Flaxseed meal  
* Â¾ cup oat flour (by grinding oats in blender)  
* Â¾ cup brown sugar  
* 2 tsp baking soda  
* 1 tsp baking powder  
* 2 tsp cinnamon  
* 2 cups pureed or shredded carrots  
* 2 cups shredded apple  
* Â¾ cup low fat milk  
* 2 eggs  
* 1 tsp vanilla  
* 1 cup dried cranberries

I used all spelt flour for the flour, and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup molasses for the brown sugar. I didnt have any milk, so I used kefir. I also added protein powder, [chia seeds](http://www.care2.com/greenliving/chia-seeds-an-ancient-american-super-food.html) and hazelnuts. I didn&#8217;t bother with dried fruit.

The muffins turned out okay, although they seem a bit doughy and I probably could have let them bake awhile longer. I had thought because of the applesauce they may naturally be a bit moist, but I think I could have been a bit more patient. But, they&#8217;re edible and portable and healthy &#8211; that&#8217;s good enough for me! 

I also made a double batch of the peanut butter chickpea granola bars to take this weekend- AND I found out our hotel has a hot breakfast buffet. I think I&#8217;ll be ok! ðŸ™‚
