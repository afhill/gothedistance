#### Food/Supplements

&#8211; half an Ezekiel English muffin with peanut butter and hemp seed  
&#8211; Gaspari SuperPump Max  
&#8211; Monster Aminos with creatine  
&#8211; Amazing meal  
&#8211; quinoa with coconut milk, hemp seed and blueberries  
&#8211; veggie juice! carrots, rainbow chard, cilantro, apple, lemon. A half lemon was a bit much&#8230;  
&#8211; sesame tofu with quinoa  
&#8211; homemade guacamole with multi-seed crackers  
&#8211; [healthy ginger spice cake](http://cleancuisineandmore.com/healthy-gingerbread-spice-cake-with-butternut-squash-puree/) with coconut milk whipped cream. I skipped the brown sugar, adding 1/3 cup honey and an extra dash of molasses, and instead of butternut squash puree used a cup of avocado. I also added whey protein. It turned out ok, but not overly sweet (hence the whipped cream). This is clean by my standards (no artificial sweeteners) although obviously should be considered a treat.  
&#8211; [mashed sweet potatoes](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/mashed_sweet_potatoes_with_coconut_milk.html) (sweet potatoes, coconut milk, ginger. Simple, clean, delicious), steamed asparagus w/ nutritional yeast  
&#8211; Vega sports protein. Also, I received an email today that Vega is selling off their original style sports protein (what I drink) at buy one, get one free. This stuff is pretty pricey, so this was a great deal. If anyone&#8217;s interested, the [coupon code is BOGOPROTEIN 12](http://shop.sequelnaturals.com/sequel-estore-us/Vega-Sport?range=33%2C41%2C41), and you still get free shipping. 

#### Exercise

I tried the Gaspari SuperPump Max and had a really great workout &#8211; check out my [complete review](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/supplement-review-gaspari-superpump-max/). Chest and tris  
&#8211; Week 4, workout 2 of the pushup challenge: 25, 29, 25, 25, 35 (was supposed to do 36 at the end, couldn&#8217;t manage it. But I got in over 150 pushups today in total!)
