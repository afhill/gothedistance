Yesterday I made it to the gym for the first time in forever. I got on the treadmill, did the following:

1mile @ 10mm  
&#8211;weights  
.5mile @ 9mm  
&#8211;weights  
.5mile @ 8mm  
&#8211;weights  
.5mile @ 7mm

So all in all, 2.5 miles. Nothing too outstanding, but it felt good to be alternating with the weights, and the short periods of running felt pretty good. I had thought about trying for a bout at 6mm, but the 7 felt fast enough for now ðŸ™‚

I think I&#8217;m going to try something like this weekly, perhaps doing a &#8216;real&#8217; ladder and coming back down to the slower speed.
