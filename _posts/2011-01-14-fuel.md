Yesterday I was actually daydreaming about Starbucks&#8217; Chai! This morning I treated myself to a Starbucks frappucino since it was in my fridge anyway. Wow &#8211; it&#8217;s funny to feel the difference already. I definitely get the energy from it, but it&#8217;s almost as though I can feel the spike. 

I&#8217;m not going to quit caffeine altogether, but I may see this as a sort of treat when I am prepared for the buzz.
