I had planned to get up and go to the gym this morning (even had my clothes laid out in the bathroom), but I felt an overall fatigue on waking that prompted me to turn off my alarm and get some more sleep. Listening to your body is so important! It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that I knew I wasn&#8217;t taking a rest day &#8211; I had a good workout with the RRBs planned.

#### Exercise

9 miles in 1:13. [Crazy great workout!](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/02/the-closest-ive-ever-come-to-puking-during-a-workout/)

#### Food

It wasn&#8217;t a great food day. I was hungry and lazy, not a good combo-  
&#8211; carrot, apple, cilantro juice  
&#8211; warm quinoa with coconut milk, cinnamon, blueberries  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; banana  
&#8211; coconut water  
&#8211; almond butter and hemp seed sandwich on Ezekiel bread  
&#8211; homemade kale chips. Wow! I&#8217;d bought these at the store before and they were gross. But upon recommendation from the clerk at Natural Grocers, I decided to give them a try. And promptly ate an entire (head?) of kale. No, I&#8217;m not exaggerating.  
&#8211; taco pasta leftovers  
&#8211; 1 beer (I told myself I could drink 2x/week! This was &#8216;beer night&#8217; after our workout, so I decided to partake. You know, to be polite!)  
&#8211; half a vega pre-workout energizer  
&#8211; vega post-sport recovery  
&#8211; vega sport protein  
&#8211; &#8220;food should taste good&#8221; chips and non-dairy &#8220;hickory cheddar&#8221; cheese. This was my attempt to quell my nacho obsession. It tasted ok, although then I remembered when I made my own nut cheese and I wondered why I just bought some.  
&#8211; blueberry chia pudding

The multitude of Vega products is because I&#8217;m reviewing them. It&#8217;s not purely laziness! 

Oh, cutest thing ever. I was at Natural Grocers and a mom came in with her two sons, aged about 2 and 4. The 4 year old walks by the produce and says &#8220;Mommy, can we get some wheatgwass?&#8221;
