I know there are a few thoughts on the statement &#8220;Food is Fuel&#8221;. For some, that&#8217;s all it is. Take in what we need to make our bodies perform. For others, food has more meaning: it speaks to culture and even pleasure. 

When I started thinking more about nutrition earlier in 2011, I read a number of books (I know, surprise, surprise). 

  * [In Defense of Food](http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/1594201455) by Michael Pollan
  * [Eating Animals](http://www.amazon.com/Eating-Animals-Jonathan-Safran-Foer/dp/0316069884) by Jonathan Safran Foer (and by the way, if you ever need that extra nudge to becoming vegetarian or vegan, this book&#8217;ll do it for you)
  * [The Eat Clean Diet Recharged](http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Clean-Diet-Recharged-Lasting-Better/dp/1552100677)
  * [Thrive: The Vegan Nutrition Guide to Optimal Performance in Sports and Life](http://www.amazon.com/Thrive-Nutrition-Optimal-Performance-Sports/dp/0738212547)

While I&#8217;m not vegan (and in fact still eat seafood on occasion so I&#8217;m not even truly vegetarian), these books really helped me to just think more about what I am putting in my body. 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/astronautfood.jpg" alt="" title="astronautfood" width="255" height="255" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2787" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/astronautfood.jpg)I&#8217;ve always been more of a &#8220;fueler&#8221; than an eater for eating&#8217;s sake. I recall my mom telling me that she had to ask the doctor how to make me eat. His response was &#8220;she&#8217;ll eat when she&#8217;s hungry&#8221;. Honestly, for a long time I think if I could have lived off those [astronaut packaged meals](http://www.astronautfoods.com) we saw in the space museum when was a kid , I&#8217;d have been content. I was REALLY picky: certain textures or even the smells of certain foods would make me lose my appetite. I ate because, you know, you have to, but I&#8217;ve never really been at the mercy of food. 

The one interesting exception was that I used to eat a lot of chocolate. In college I probably ate a chocolate bar a day. I went to a homeopathic doctor and he actually asked if I craved chocolate. Apparently my body wasn&#8217;t absorbing calcium sufficiently, which caused the craving. He had me start taking a calcium/magnesium supplement and the cravings dissipated. 

I&#8217;m busy, and I never learned to cook.. all culminating in someone not really motivated to eat well, who isn&#8217;t great at feeding herself. 

In late 2002 I was on some medication that affected my appetite (just what I need, right?) I&#8217;d go to the grocery and literally wander the aisles looking for something that looked appetizing. My weight dropped below 100lbs. I wanted to eat, but nothing looked good. (Hmm, I just realized I don&#8217;t know if my parents know my weight dropped that much.. hi Mom!) 

At the same time, I was wanting to get back into running, something I&#8217;d enjoyed but stopped due to injury. It was in an interview of a female ultrarunner that I first read about the notion of &#8220;food as fuel&#8221;. She explained it very clearly, that she knew she needed to fuel and maintain her body as a vehicle to get it to perform. And it all clicked. It really didn&#8217;t matter if things on the shelf looked appetizing, a car doesn&#8217;t get to decide if it wants a fill or not. It gets what it needs. 

So that helped me learn to fuel, at least calorie-wise. And that did me fine for a long time. But in late 2010 I started thinking it was time to treat the ole vehicle a bit better. There ARE different grades of gas, after all. I read [Fast Track: Training and Nutrition Secrets from America&#8217;s Top Female Runner](http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Track-Training-Nutrition-Americas/dp/1594860130) and that helped a bit, but it wasn&#8217;t until I learned about the Eat Clean Diet from some skaters in town that things really clicked. The plan is pretty straightforward (no white flour, no white rice, no white sugar, no processed food, no alcohol, no saturated fats). Simple ingredients, mix a complex carb with a fat at every meal, and voila! You&#8217;re feeding your body what it needs, not a lot of additives. 

Since I&#8217;m an eater out of necessity rather than pleasure, I think adopting an eating plan is pretty easy for me. Sure, I have cheat days but it&#8217;s not as though I&#8217;m anxiously awaiting those days so I can have some treat I crave. Even when my 90 day TBT program was over, I still maintained many of the same eating habits, because the principles of the program just make sense. Sure, I can eat sugary crap on cheat days, but if I understand all the negatives is does to your body, why would I want to?? To paraphrase Kate Moss, &#8220;nothing tastes as good as being fit feels.&#8221; If anything, through the Eat Clean Diet I&#8217;ve started eating more: more frequently, more protein and more fresh produce. Really for the first time in my life I take pride in throwing some ingredients together and coming up with something good. Oh, it&#8217;s still fuel. But I take pride in it being GOOD fuel! 

I have a friend, she&#8217;s a good athlete and works out a lot. I feel like nutritionally, she&#8217;s where I was a few years ago. She joked to me that she couldn&#8217;t do the TBT because without string cheese, she&#8217;d starve. We go for a morning run and she is hungry partway through because she didn&#8217;t eat first. It&#8217;s just an eye-opener to me to see how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m religious about refueling post-workout so I can recover and be stronger for the next workout. 

I know some people work out so they can eat what they want. I eat what I have to so I can work out.
