When I mentioned on Facebook I needed knee surgery, I received a few recommendations for [Dr. Grauer](http://www.orthopro.com/j-david-grauer-m-d/). I managed to get in to see him for a consult within a day, and he was great; took the time to explain the various options I had and then we set up an appointment for the surgery the next week. After a month of limping around, I was eager to have it looked after.

As the time grew nearer I was a bit more nervous, but my parents came to Boulder to look after me for a few days, which was great.

Yesterday was the big day: originally my check-in was scheduled for 8:45 for a 10:15 surgery, but it got pushed back to check-in at 10:15 for an 11:45 surgery. I joked that that just gave me more time to be hungry before the appointment (I couldn&#8217;t have any food or drink after midnight) but the time passed not too bad and I surprisingly didn&#8217;t get too anxious in the extra time.

Things were running behind so we waited in the waiting room for awhile, and then once I was brought back to prep I had some more time to wait. My pulse was a nice relaxed 56BPM, despite being ready to undergo a medical procedure. The radiologist and Dr. Grauer both came in to see me, as well as a steady stream of nurses to check on me. My parents came back and waited with me for awhile and then at close to 1pm it was go-time! The anesthesiologist got me started and by the time they&#8217;d wheeled me into the operating room I was nearly gone.

Unlike past surgeries where I&#8217;ve woken up groggy and confused (in one case I kept trying to sit up and was told to lay back down), in this case it was as though I just woke up from a good sleep: I wasn&#8217;t groggy or confused. I was wheeled out to the recovery room to enjoy some apple juice and apple sauce (no crackers please and thanks&#8230;) and then my parents were allowed to come see me. Apparently the surgeon had been out to chat with them. I was given some instructions for recovery and was surprised that I was at least somewhat lucid enough to understand them. The nurse told me I had to keep the dressing on my leg until my follow-up appointment, to which I asked her what kind of dressing &#8211; ranch? vinagrette? I took this as a sign I was doing well &#8211; it probably actually meant the drugs were still working ðŸ™‚

The piece of my cartilage that was broken off was apparently bigger than they expected &#8211; nearly a half-inch- and so they performed a mosaicplasty. They removed two small pieces of cartilage from elsewhere in my knee to form plugs to fill in the hole. I&#8217;m glad to hear they went with this procedure because I anticipate it will be better for my future activity.

Instead, I was told to keep it immobile for healing. I asked the nurse about it, and apparently I&#8217;d also asked Dr. Grauer after the surgery in a conversation I don&#8217;t recall&#8230;

My blood pressure was a little high so I had to wait around a bit, and I did feel a little sore and icky so I started on my Percocet and had some anti-nausea medication before we left the hospital. I&#8217;d been told to take Percocet every 4 hours to keep things under control &#8211; because there are three areas of impact, it was anticipated to be a little more painful than had they done the microfracture. The nurse told me to take note of whether I urinated or not within the first 24 hours; if not, I&#8217;d have to come back and have a catheter put in. I promptly told her that wouldn&#8217;t be an issue, and asked to use the restroom right then! On the road to recovery!

We were home around 4:30 pm and I actually felt just fine &#8211; not really groggy as I had anticipated. I had a green smoothie (which tasted great after nearly 24 hours of not eating!) and then some miso soup and a bit of a Boulder Veggie bowl from Tokyo Joes. Again, I was really surprised that my stomach felt ok. I read a bit and went to bed at a reasonable hour (10:30) and drifted off just fine, despite the fact my leg was in a brace and elevated.

[<img class="alignleft size-full" alt="20130620-200138.jpg" src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/20130620-200138.jpg" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/20130620-200138.jpg)At midnight and 4am, my Percocet alarm sounded and I had a couple rice chips and a pill. The only downside was that it was difficult to drift off to sleep again afterwards: I just didn&#8217;t feel sleepy (probably because I hadn&#8217;t expended much energy that day).

Today&#8217;s been great as well &#8211; had a green smoothie and a Bhakti Chai coffee blend drink for breakfast, relaxed and read and listened to podcasts. I&#8217;ve taken the meds on the schedule they gave me, but the &#8216;pain&#8217; has really not gone above a dull ache, perhaps a 2 on a scale of 1-10. A nurse from the surgical center called me around 11 and asked how I was, if I&#8217;d been able to eat at all. I nearly laughed! My swelling has also gone down amazingly &#8211; I&#8217;ve had to tighten the straps on my brace a good inch and a half all the way down.

Today we went for a drive in the afternoon and I crutched around to a restaurant on Pearl St. Apparently using crutches is like riding a bike, I feel quite comfortable using them, although my sides where I am holding the crutches against my body is a bit tight (I have them short enough they&#8217;re nowhere near my armpits).

The other thing I was warned about was the ability of the percocet to cause constipation, so I made it my goal to have a bowel movement today. Sure, that&#8217;s probably not something you completely have control over (haha), but I wanted to do my best. It helps when you eat the way I do &#8211; two green smoothies, a chai/coffee blended beverage and then hummus, falafel and veggies, and I reached my goal! Which is pretty good considering it&#8217;s easy to find blog posts like this one: [Life After Knee Surgery &#8211; Week 1: Percocet, Sleep and Constipation](http://andrewsacks.wordpress.com/2010/06/06/week-1-percocet-sleep-and-constipation/).

Indeed, it seems I&#8217;m scoring a big A on recovery &#8211; very little discomfort, good bodily functions, no grogginess. It&#8217;s probably strange to say, but I am really SO thankful I got this looked after and I&#8217;m very optimistic for the future.

I&#8217;ve determined that Injury Madness is worse than Taper Madness and I&#8217;m eagerly reading up on different events for the fall and next year. I have no reason to believe I&#8217;ll be hindered in any way by this setback. The whole experience was very positive and I&#8217;m so glad I selected the team I did!
