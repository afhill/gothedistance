So after my inverted ankle at the [Pikes Peak marathon](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2010/09/pikes-peak-marathon-race-report-30/), I decided enough is enough. (Ok, and my derby coach may have also said something). What&#8217;s up with the frequent ankle injuries? Is this something I can actually work on preventing?

Last November I started going to a chiropractor. Although that&#8217;s helped with my headaches and posture, I&#8217;ve actually noticed my left knee and side has been giving me more problems when I run. Too many years of overcompensating?

The fact is, I participate in two high-impact sports that&#8217;ll take a toll on any body, and here I am doing it on a leg that&#8217;s been compromised in its own right. I don&#8217;t like to do anything half-way, so of course I did my research and found an outstanding clinic to go to. It turns out the [Steadman-Hawkins Clinic](http://www.shcdenver.com/) is less than 5 miles from my office: _The Steadman Hawkins Clinics have some of the best trained and most experienced physicians in the field of sports medicine and orthopaedic surgery in the Greenwood Village, Vail and Breckenridge, Colorado area. They are experts at diagnosing and treating orthopaedic and sports medicine problems. In addition, our treatment techniques are on the leading edge, utilizing progressive programs that are designed to achieve optimal results with physician, patient and therapist working as a team toward the goal of full recovery. Throughout the process, each patientâ€™s needs remain the primary focus of the team._ 

I made an appointment to see Dr. Shank, who took x-rays and determined there was nothing seriously wrong with my ankle, and then we set me up with some physical therapy. Today was the day I went in and met Matt.. and I was really glad I finally made this decision. I know I&#8217;m not the most flexible, but he really validated that for me. He commented on my lack of flexibility and muscular imbalances, and then hooked me up with a serious of exercises. He also recommended I get a foam roller (something my Mom swears by), so I went and got one. 

Basically, my left leg (the one I injured) is much weaker than the right. My hips are super tight. He seemed concerned with the lack of range of motion in my knee: generally apparently a knee should be able to move left and right and up and down fairly easily: mine doesn&#8217;t. And my flexibility is nowhere near it needs to be. When we were walking through some of the exercises he gave me, I mentioned there was something I do, but basically I feel little &#8216;cracks&#8217; through my calves while I do it. Again, he validated my thoughts and told me that was pretty rare and definitely was a sign I needed to do this work. 

Some of the exercises he gave me:

  1. single leg bridges
  2. hip circles
  3. sideways band walks
  4. ball hamstring curls
  5. straight leg raises with weights
  6. planks
  7. single leg calf raises

There were a number of other exercises I could do if I belonged to a gym, but I don&#8217;t ðŸ™‚ I am supposed to do 3-5 of these different strengthening exercises 3-4 times a week, and also stretch daily. I need to use the foam roller to roll out my hips, calves and quads, and also [the stick](http://thestick.com/) (the poor guy seemed so hopeful when I said I had a stick, and then disheartened when I told him I never used it)

I also have a &#8220;no&#8221; list &#8211; because right now I do a lot of impact stuff, he wanted me not to do more. So, no lunges, deep squats or high step ups. Yes! 

So, I&#8217;m pretty geeked out about this stuff: the idea that as well as I&#8217;m able to perform physically now, I can get better. Just for fun, I just grabbed a tape measure to check out this muscle imbalance (he mentioned the difference in &#8216;girth&#8217; between my legs). My right quad is about an inch bigger than my left. So, now of course the challenge for me will be actually DOING the exercises, but I hope my followup appointment in a couple weeks will keep me dedicated, and make me stronger.
