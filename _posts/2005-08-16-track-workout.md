well today was my first ever track workout. My schedule called for _&#8220;VO2 max 10 mi w/ 5 x 1,000 m @ 5K race pace (7:04); jog 2 min between&#8221;_. I plugged those times into a pace calculator, and it spit out the following:  
1000m = 4:23  
400m = 1:45  
200m = .53

I also decided to try to keep my &#8216;slower&#8217; pace at about 400m = 2:14, or roughly a 9 min mile. I planned:

20 laps @ 2:14  
5x (2.5 laps @ 1:45, 1 lap @ 2:14 recovery)  
4 laps cooldown

And it went pretty well! I actually found I was going out too hard on the intervals, but I managed to pull back. I did stop for some gatorade after the 3rd interval, but overall I felt good. I distinctly remember thinking &#8220;my 5K time is soft&#8221;. ðŸ™‚

Because my watch only keeps 30 splits, I only did splits every 2nd lap for the &#8216;slow&#8217; times. the first two were off b/c I ran down the street in addition to a lap, so they don&#8217;t count ðŸ™‚

*messed this one up, stopped partway through, walked to next marker and restarted  
Cumulative time: 1:24  
Ok, so I don&#8217;t know how I managed to come up with 10.75 right there.

20 laps warm-up = 5miles  
5x(2.5 laps fast) = 12.5 laps = ~3.1 miles  
4x(1 lap slow) = 4 laps = 1 mile  
4 laps cooldown = 1 mile  
should be an even 10 miles. Oh well. I blame it on metrics.

Overall, I hit my 4:23 on my intervals every time, without too much trouble. I went easy on my &#8216;slow&#8217; laps, but other than between intervals, stayed below 2:13 per lap. I feel pretty good, too, and surprisingly spending nearly an hour and a half circling a track wasn&#8217;t too monotonous! And if I put any stock in Yasso 800s,I&#8217;m all ready for that 3:30 in Steamtown!
