Years ago, I saw I had a resting heart rate of 48. Recently I was asked about it again, and when I tried to check it, never saw it dip below 60-something. 

A few friends got heart rate monitors for Christmas, and I was surprised to see several of them with resting heart rates well below my own. Certainly they&#8217;re healthy and fit, but it was still a bit of a surprise to see that mine was higher. (Disclaimer: it&#8217;s still great [according to sources](http://www.buzzle.com/articles/resting-heart-rate-chart.html), but I expect it to be lower) And while I know I can function with my heart rate quite high for an extended period of time, I wanted to consider why it is as it is. 

Last year when I had a physical, I was told I have borderline high blood pressure. I already do many of the [behaviors that can be used to manage this](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/PreventionTreatmentofHighBloodPressure/Prevention-Treatment-of-High-Blood-Pressure_UCM_002054_Article.jsp): I&#8217;m not overweight, I exercise, and I don&#8217;t smoke. But I&#8217;ve recently started thinking that I&#8217;d do well to look at limiting my sodium.

Tonight I did a little [research on resting heart rate](http://www.buzzle.com/articles/high-resting-heart-rate.html), and as I suspected, there is a possible link between high blood pressure and a high resting heart rate. Some of the other possible causes include:  
* Heart Disease  
* Congenital Heart Defects  
* Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)  
* Heavy Consumption of Alcohol  
* Smoking  
* Heavy Caffeine Intake  
* Hyperthyroidism  
* Electrolyte Imbalance  
* Consumption of Recreational Drugs Like Cocaine  
* Reaction to Medicinal Drugs  
* Extreme Stress and Anxiety

Not a lot of those are relevant, but a few could be (stress, high blood pressure, caffeine?). So, I&#8217;m going to work on my nutrition just for overall better health. I&#8217;ve actually never been a table salt user, so I&#8217;m not terribly concerned about that. Interestingly enough once I started running I actually started eating salty snacks more, but I just may dial that back ðŸ™‚
