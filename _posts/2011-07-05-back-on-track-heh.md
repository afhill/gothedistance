#### Exercise

I did one day from the [Get Your Summer Body](http://www.muscleandfitnesshers.com/training/get-your-summer-body) workout from Muscle and Fitness hers, it kicked my butt!

  * pushups to dumbbell rows
  * dumbbell romanian deadlifts superset with dumbbell sumo squats
  * incline chest press superset with wide-grip pullups
  * dumbbell lunges superset with leg press (was supposed to be leg extensions, whoops!)
  * lying leg curls superset with standing calf raises
  * barbell upright rows triset with standing barbell military presses and dumbell lateral raises
  * bench dips superset with standing dumbbell bicep curls
  * some random abs, since there wasn&#8217;t a medicine ball to do medicine ball v-ups, and I&#8217;d feel weird doing kneeling cable row crunches
