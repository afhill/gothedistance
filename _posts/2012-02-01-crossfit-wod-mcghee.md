I FINALLY went into Crossfit Lodo for a workout. I didn&#8217;t feel like it seemed too intimidating a workout:

> McGhee:  
> AMRAP 30 minutes
> 
>   * 5 deadlifts
>   * 13 pushups
>   * 9 box jumps



I went for 115lbs for the deadlift and &#8220;games&#8221; (hand-release) pushups (where you actually lift your hands off the ground when your chest is on the ground). After a few rounds, my lower back was starting to hurt and so the trainer gave me some advice on the lift. This slowed me down a bit ðŸ˜‰ It made a big difference in my technique. As I started to incorporate other parts of my body it actually felt a bit more awkward, but I know it&#8217;ll be way better for me. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t pick up on the new technique before causing my back to complain. 

In the end I did 14 rounds even. Shew! As the guy says in the video, the pushups DID end up being the hardest part. I could get to 8 fine, then had to take a brief pause, and then struggled to get the rest done. Often that last one killed me! By the end, I&#8217;d given up on the hand release, but was always careful to get my chest all the way down to the ground.
