This week I had the following on the books:

  1. 70-80min easy run
  2. 20-30min easy run
  3. fartlek run &#8211; 15-30min w/u, 6-8x(4min medium-hard, 90sec recovery), 15-30min c/d 
      * 65-80min easy run
      * 20-30min easy run
      * 90min progression run
      * 20-30min easy run</ol> 
    This week I had my folks visiting, and a business trip to San Jose planned. I left for California right after work on Wednesday, returned at midnight Thursday evening and had a meeting at work at 8am Friday. Did I mention I also had family in town, including a Mom who is also a runner? I still think I did a pretty good job at getting things in. 
    
      1. 73min easy run (8.5 miles @ 8:38mm)
      2. 29:36 easy run with Mom (2.7 miles @ 11:10)
      3. 1.5 mile bonus speed run after I locked my keys in the car after the above (7:27mm)
      4. fartlek run (7 miles in 59:50 &#8211; 8:33mm)
      5. 74min easy run (9 miles @ 8:14mm)
      6. 28min easy run with Mom (2.6 miles @ 10:59mm)
      7. 85min easy run with Mom (7.5 miles @ 11:28mm)
    
    Obviously, &#8216;easy&#8217; runs with Mom were at a bit of a different pace than on my own, but I got the time in on my feet. The one big discrepancy is the long run, I needed to do a progression run and it just wasn&#8217;t convenient to do that while they were here. I had planned to get up and do it this morning before work, but I couldn&#8217;t find my headphones and couldn&#8217;t bear the idea of 90min on the treadmill without them! So the plan is to get it in tomorrow. 
    
    Overall, I&#8217;m still feeling pretty good about it all. Tonight I went out for my 20-30min run, and ended up pushing it hard and getting in 2.6 miles in 20:09 (7:54mm). Overall I&#8217;m feeling strong, and the fact that this is still &#8220;pre&#8221;-marathon training according to my schedule makes me happy! This week is actually the first week that&#8217;s considered &#8220;marathon&#8221; training, and it actually even gives me the option of an off day (I&#8217;ve been taking one day off per week anyway, but it&#8217;s nice that the option is built in; it will give me the chance to &#8216;catch up&#8217; on the progression run tomorrow).
