Earlier today I wrote about how I was going to try to start doing some food prep, so of course I set right to it.

I decided to start with something simple: [Quinoa Black Bean Salad](http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/vegetarian-recipes/quinoa-black-bean-salad.php). I went to Whole Foods with shopping list in hand, and got ready for the big cooking adventure.

I went with Ginger instead of Jalapeno (in retrospect, I think it would have been nice with both), skipped the tomato but included carrot and the red pepper. I forgot how wonderful basil smells! 

I thought I&#8217;d try to go all out and buy bulk black beans, but the &#8220;soak for 6-8 hours&#8221; was too much for me, however well-intentioned I am. I have no problem [running for that long](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2006/03/crown-king-scramble-race-report/), the idea of spending that much time (however passively) preparing a meal is not appealing. So, canned beans it was! 

Overall I think it turned out all right. The dressing was a little bland (I don&#8217;t use pepper and I didn&#8217;t have curry powder) but I added more lime juice and some grated cheese and it ended up pretty tasty.

I&#8217;m also excited about the fact there is TONS and I&#8217;ll be able to make a couple meals from it.
