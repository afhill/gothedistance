2009 was a pretty rough year for me, run-wise. This year I feel definitely renewed and ready to go! Although roller derby hasn&#8217;t officially started yet, I did have several meetings in the evenings that kept me busy: hopefully once I start skating again I will continue to get my runs in. 

I have been more conscious of my stride and form as of late, in part due to my chiropractic appointments. My overall form may be improving, or it may just be the distraction I need, but it&#8217;s less of a struggle to hit the trails these days. And I&#8217;ve felt it easier to pick up the pace!

Mon: off

Tues: 2 miles on the treadmill before work; .25mi warmup, 1.5 miles @ 7:15 pace, .25mi cooldown. AvgHR: 171, MaxHR: 184 max 

Wed: 3 miles outside, with great splits: 9:24, 8:09, 7:15. Total time: 24:50. I forgot my HRM!

Thurs: 3 miles on the treadmill in 24:29 (8:10 pace &#8211; 8:20, 8:05, 8:03). AvgHR: 161 MaxHR 175

Fri: off

Sat: Recovery run: 11.5 miles in 2:02:44 (10:40 min/mile) AvgHR 148 MaxHR 163

Sun: Met the Incline Club, decided to do the Incline, then up to Barr Camp. 13miles: 3:15:09. AvgHR 154 MaxHR 176. Gorgeous weather, but I definitely should have brought Yak Traks. I probably walked half of the way down from Barr Camp because I was worried about slipping on ice.

Weekly mileage: 32.5

I also realized that I&#8217;m now a Brooks girl: both my trail shoes and my road shoes are Brooks.
