Yesterday I had my post-op follow up with Dr. Grauer. First a medical assistant came in and removed my stitches. Since I had staples, not stitches, with my first leg surgery, I was actually a bit nervous about this. But we joked around and I looked the other way as he did his work and other than a weird pulling sensation, it was fine. (It actually reminded me of a root canal &#8211; where you feel sensation but no pain). His big joke? That my days as a leg model were over..

Then Dr. Grauer came in and the first thing he asked was &#8220;do you remember talking to me after the surgery? I don&#8217;t, so I wonder what I said!

He seemed content with my progress and said it&#8217;s time to start with Physical Therapy! Yippee! But still no weight-bearing for 6 weeks, which I expected.

I asked him about cycling and swimming. He said the concern with cycling is my putting weight on my right leg, so if I want to cycle, I should remove my right pedal. As for swimming, if I want to do that, I should put a &#8230;buoy or paddleboard or something?&#8230; between my legs so I don&#8217;t kick! So much for anticipating those sports would be recommended for rehabbing my leg&#8230;. He did end up saying swimming was probably the better of the two, but it just cracked me up that I thought those would be good for exercising my leg, and he wanted me to continue not to use the leg!  
He did tell me to do some straight leg lifts to get some of the muscle back, so there IS that.

They have these cool knee pads of paper at the office so he drew on it where my injury was and how they fit in the two plugs to &#8216;fix it&#8217;. Cool!

In addition to being able to start PT, I also got the exciting news that I can now get my scar wet! Not soak in it a hot tub quite yet, but at least I no longer need to hang it out the bathtub when I shower! Til now I&#8217;ve been sitting on a shower stool and using the handheld showerhead as otherwise the stream would be hitting me in the face. Now I can keep the showerhead mounted and actually use both hands to wash my hair. Seriously folks, don&#8217;t take this stuff for granted!

So &#8211; good stuff! I&#8217;m still very happy that I had the surgery done and although there is still plenty more recovery to come, I&#8217;m ready for it! I&#8217;ll give it the time it needs (Dr. Grauer cautioned that around the 5-6 week mark will be tough b/c I&#8217;ll feel fine, but we can&#8217;t sense that some recovery still needs to take place). I get it &#8211; I&#8217;m not going to push it here. I&#8217;m not going to compromise years more of activity for two weeks!
