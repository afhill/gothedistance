I woke up &#8211; over and over, all night &#8211; feeling soooo sick. I had a fever, the type where your lips are swollen and parched. I was miserable!! I think I actually got some sun at the Corn Maze yesterday and it somehow just pushed me over the edge. 

Thankfully, I&#8217;d made an appointment with my chiropractor for my back, and he works miracles. The slightest neck adjustment has been known to clear up my sinus problems. Otherwise, he sells this homeopathic [Biothymus Complex](http://www.ndinutraceuticals.com/health-concerns/details/294/9/endocrine-support/bio-thymus-complex---1-oz) that has also been known to give my immune system a jump-start. 

Sure enough, after the adjustment my back is feeling better and over the course of the day I&#8217;m starting to feel like I&#8217;m coming back from the dead. Still sniffly but not nearly as bad. Still, I&#8217;m taking another danged rest day. Ugh!
