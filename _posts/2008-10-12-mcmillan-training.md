In one week, I&#8217;ll have completed the [Denver Marathon](http://www.denvermarathon.com). And then, my sights are firmly set on a big PR, the elusive sub-3:23:00 in [Phoenix](http://www.rnraz.com/home.html) on January 19th! 

I haven&#8217;t really followed any sort of a training program this year. I ran Boston, the Flying Pig, the Buckeye Trail 50K and the Edmonton marathon within 4 months. Then with getting a new job and moving across the country, I didn&#8217;t have time to really focus on the Denver race either. I liked not feeling obligation to a training plan, but believe me, I am ready for structure! As well, the Phoenix race is exactly 13 weeks after Denver, so I have the perfect amount of time to settle down and really focus. 

I had been considering the Pfitz plan, as I shaved 8 minutes off my PR from 2004 to 2005. However, I have been incorporating many of the Pfitz workouts for a few years, and I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was the best to continue along this same path. I was just looking at the [McMillan Running Calculator](http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/mcmillanrunningcalculator.htm) to determine what some of my training paces would be, when I noticed the link at the top of the page: &#8220;[custom training programs](http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/ctp.htm)&#8220;. Yes, Greg McMillan offers personal training, but you can also buy a personalized plan for 8, 12, 16 or 20 weeks. You fill out a questionnaire about your history, goals, life schedule, and after evaluation and follow-up, you get a personalized plan. 

I think I have some interesting &#8220;quirks&#8221; related to my running: my ability to recover quickly, the fact I don&#8217;t have much variation in pace regardless of distance, etc. After 21 marathons, I will be eager to see what sort of suggestions can be made.
