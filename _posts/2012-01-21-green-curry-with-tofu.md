With tonight&#8217;s meal, I am officially proclaiming that I can cook!

Green curry with tofu and brown rice

I bought some green curry paste and kaffir lime leaves awhile ago, intending to make my own green curry sometime. I decided tonight was the night, and found a pretty simple [recipe on allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/green-curry-tofu/detail.aspx). I threw the rice in the rice cooker and went to start the tofu, and realized I only had silken tofu in the fridge. What? So I made a mad dash to sunflower market to grab tofu. En route I reflected on the fact that this recipe doesn&#8217;t really have any veggies listed, so I looked up a secondary [vegan thai curry vegetable](http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/the-temporary-vegetarian-vegan-thai-curry-vegetables/) recipe, and decided to do a mix of the two. While I was at Sunflower, I noticed they have brown basmati rice, so I&#8217;ll have to try that for next time! I also picked up squash, red pepper and eggplant for my veggies. 

1. Rice in the rice cooker. Check  
2. Pressed tofu lightly fried in 3 tbps sesame oil. Check (note: I started this a little early, given the more complicated curry I ended up making)  
3. Then for the actual curry, this is where the recipes diverged. The first one was very basic, 5 minutes of simmering a mix of a few things. Both mentioned adding brown sugar, which I planned to avoid. However, the first recipe&#8217;s comments suggested adding peanut butter, so I decided to do that. Other than that, I followed the second recipe:

3a. Scoop 6 tbsp of coconut cream from a can of coconut milk, bring to bubbling over medium  
3b. Add curry paste (it said 6 tbsp, that seemed like a lot so I added 4ish, then a bit more paste as I got less scared.), stir until it becomes &#8220;aromatic&#8221;  
3c. Add in veggies  
3d. Pour in the rest of the coconut milk  
3e. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 min  
3f. At some point, remember you have kaffir leaves and throw them in &#8211; 2 tbsp and a bit of juice  
3g. Also, combine a half cup of veggie broth, 4 tsp soy sauce and a dollop of peanut butter in a small bowl  
3h. Add the soy sauce mixture to the curry  
3i. Tell yourself how awesome you are, and enjoy!
