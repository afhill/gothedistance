Lately I&#8217;ve been doing some workouts that have included some faster running with Meredith. These have been good for me, to break out of the monotony and &#8220;easy&#8221; running I&#8217;ve become used to. And..it may be paying off!

I missed my 20 miler this weekend, there is just so much going on. Lately many of my workouts have been running errands: yesterday to the bank, today to the car rental place and then from a stop to drop off my car (it&#8217;s now en route to Colorado, where I&#8217;m flying on Sunday). 

Today on my runs I felt GREAT! The run out to the car rental place was 2.15 miles, down a bit of a sloping hill. I felt like I was flying, and as it turned out, my pace was 7:21 overall. That&#8217;s 7:50 for the first mile, 7:02 for the second, and then 6:05mm for the last .15miles. I&#8217;m not sure what the guy at Enterprise thought about giving the sweaty girl the keys to the car ðŸ™‚ 

Later on, I had to drop off my car for transport. He offered to drive me home, but I decided I&#8217;d run it as well. For some reason, I pushed it even harder than this morning. I stopped at a traffic light just as my watch hit a mile: 7:32. Nice! I kept going, and just as I hit mile 2, I stopped to walk. I glanced at my watch: 6:54. Well darnit, if I&#8217;m running that well, I can&#8217;t walk! I was flying (and dying!) when I hit the third mile at 6:38. At this point I could do enough math to realize that my 5K PR of 7:04 wasn&#8217;t holding up. So when I got home at 2.93 miles I knew I had to keep running. I ran until I saw 3.1: finish time was 21:36 (6:58mm)

So, despite not having trained for a 5K, and having run two fast (for me) miles this morning, I tore out a darned good effort! This makes me feel good about my upcoming race. After 21 marathons, the distance isn&#8217;t the challenge anymore: its moving beyond that comfort pace. Today I pushed myself just that extra step, and I feel pretty good about it!

(oh &#8211; heart rate this morning: average 162, max 181; heart rate this afternoon: average 167, max 191.)
