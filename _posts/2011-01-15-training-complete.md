Just finished my last run before the marathon tomorrow. It was a target 3 mile run of 1 mile easy, and 2 at race pace (8:23). I had planned to run it yesterday but didn&#8217;t get around to it.

Today we woke up, had breakfast and went to the race expo. After a few hours wandering around we got home and it was abalmy 78. I decided to run around my parents&#8217; complex for the race.

As I started my garmin, I noticed my heart rate was at 60. This made me really happy as I can&#8217;t think of the last time I saw it at that number. I&#8217;d like to think my watching my caffeine is playing a role, although it&#8217;s possible just being at 1100 feet instead of 5500 could have an impact too!

m1: 9:16  
M2: 8:24  
M3: 8:09  
&#8212;-  
Total: 25:48 for 3 miles. AvgHR 154, maxHR 172. 

It was a bit warm, but overall I felt pretty good! I had set my garmin to only allow me between an 8:10 and an 8:30 pace and it definitely beeped at me for going too fast! I will definitely be careful not to go out too fast tomorrow. I know I feel strong, but I need to feel that way at mile 23!

It&#8217;s hard to believe I haven&#8217;t run a road marathon since May. This is a good race though, so as long as it doesn&#8217;t get too warm, I&#8217;m really looking forward to it!
