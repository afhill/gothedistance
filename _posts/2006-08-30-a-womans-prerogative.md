yesterday I was emailing Meredith that I just wasn&#8217;t feeling training this year, that if I hadn&#8217;t paid for Chicago&#8230; blah blah blah complain complain. Generally we run together on Wednesdays, 11 or 12 miles as per the Pfitz 12/55. She said she assumed I wouldn&#8217;t be running today, but I told her I&#8217;d be there.

Today she emailed me mid-morning to tell me she was actually going to run 18 today, so she&#8217;d be out at 4 and just loop back to meet me at 5 if I wanted to do the last 12 with her. To which I replied, well, I&#8217;ll just meet you at 4 and do 18 as well.

Which I did. 2:45:xx, which is a decent pace for an &#8216;easy long run&#8217;. 

My knee hurt a bit at the end of 12, but it passed. Overall, I felt really good! Surprising since I really haven&#8217;t been hydrating/eating that great as of late. I did taken an espresso gu at 6, which could have had an effect, as could have the cooler temperatures.

Late yesterday I decided I wasn&#8217;t going to be married to a plan, I was going to give myself some flexibility to enjoy running again. Last night I ran out at John Bryan State Park after work, today I went out and got myself an MP3 player (my creative muvo hasn&#8217;t worked since London, I picked up a Sandisk 1gig player). I&#8217;m going to try some different things, try short fast runs around the block, just to mix things up. This is supposed to be fun, right???
