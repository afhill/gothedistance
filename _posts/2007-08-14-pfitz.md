It&#8217;s been a long time since I actually referred to &#8220;Advanced Marathoning&#8221; beyond just the training schedules. Last night I was skimming through it (I&#8217;m now in Mesocycle 2: Lactate Threshold and Endurance) and I thought I&#8217;d work out the paces I should be running my long runs.

My supreme goal for Oct 7th is a 7:45 pace. Therefore, my long- and medium-long runs should be about 10-20% slower than that. That comes out to 8:32 &#8211; 9:19.

So far my runs have been ranging from 8:32 &#8211; 9:15, with the two slowest at Highbanks. So I appear to be right on track- Most of them are in about the 9 min mile range, but it HAS been warm!
