I was running late this morning so I didn&#8217;t eat as much as I normally do, and I definitely could tell! I was getting hangry by 11ish, and I even had a snack and till was on edge. I should know better. 

Food  
&#8211; one piece Ezekiel toast with almond butter and chia seed  
&#8211; banana  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; clif bar  
&#8211; &#8220;soup of life&#8221; buckwheat noodle bowl -Broccoli, Onion, Garlic, Cabbage, Sesame Seeds, Olive Oil, Seaweed, Tomato, Tofu, miso and more  
&#8211; nonfat unsweetened earl grey latte  
&#8211; kefir  
&#8211; blue corn chips  
&#8211; rice dream ice cream novelty &#8211; note, by the letter of the law, these are ok. No &#8216;artificial sweeteners&#8217;. by the spirit of the law I know it&#8217;s crap that doesn&#8217;t offer me any nutrition. This is why I shouldn&#8217;t grocery shop when I&#8217;m hungry.  
&#8211; bean thread noodles, wilted spinach, tomatoes in oil/vinegar with quorn meatless balls  
&#8211; pear

Exercise  
&#8211; I felt like the prodigal daughter showing up at SportXcel today. I was only in for a month of classes and I think I&#8217;ve miss the past two weeks :- Fridays are &#8220;total body&#8221; &#8211; I enjoyed the arms stuff, I literally had trouble reaching up to fix my ponytail holder partway through!
