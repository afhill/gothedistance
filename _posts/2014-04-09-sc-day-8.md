Today we started the corporate sweat equity challenge, which was fun. We&#8217;re competitive at work! I enjoyed a brief moment at the top of our leaderboard, which I will cherish.

Before work I did two sets of the stairs (got my heart rate up to 173), lifted and then did a couple courses on the Expresso bike. Then at lunch I ran 4 miles. 

With all that working out, I was HUNGRY!
