I know my Mom checks my blog, and the little &#8220;LogYourRun&#8221; widget on the bottom corner hasn&#8217;t shown any mileage as of late. Fear not, that&#8217;s just because the cord I needed to download the data from my Garmin has been at work since my business trip last week.

I just grabbed all the information and updated it &#8211; I actually had a pretty decent week last week considering my travel schedule &#8211; ran 31 miles and skated twice. (click the image to enlarge) Now that it&#8217;s getting nicer out, I don&#8217;t mind going for a run after work, and have started to do that before 8 o&#8217;clock derby practices.
