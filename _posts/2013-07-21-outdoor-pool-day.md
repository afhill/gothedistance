It was another gorgeous day in Colorado, so rather than go to the rec center, we hit up a friend&#8217;s condo pool. It was early enough the pool was empty, which I was thrilled about. That would give me the opportunity to just hang out in the shallow part of the pool and try out this walking thing. 

While last week I&#8217;d been too scared to try it, today I was able to walk around a fair amount. It was an alien sensation to step down on my foot and rotate forward.

I also practiced swimming a bit (just letting my feet dangle) and was really happy that I was able to float and swim without kicking or sinking TOO much. I had good muscle control and didn&#8217;t need the pull buoy to keep me from kicking: I just knew not to. I practiced my hip rotation and stroke and actually still did ok despite the fact my legs were dangling behind me uselessly.

I tried to work on breathing through my nose, which is still awkward for me. But I do feel like I&#8217;m making some incremental improvements everytime I hit the pool. I also was able to work on some of the basic TI drills since I didn&#8217;t have the pullbuoy trying to keep me balanced. 

Although I&#8217;m a bit embarrassed I have things to learn, at least I can feel like I&#8217;m making some progress with every time I try&#8230; it actually encourages me to want to go more often and keep trying things. Bit by bit!
