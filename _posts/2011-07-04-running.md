I definitely have a renewed interest in running and racing as of late &#8211; but naturally, the training needs to come with that. I spent some time on the plane today getting serious. Pikes Peak is only 7 weeks away, and I have plenty to do before then. Weekends are really too busy to try to get in long runs, so I am going to be creative and get up and do them before work. This is a DEFINITE perk to being able to work from home!

In general, my plan is going to be:  
Sunday: easy &#8220;prep&#8221; run of 5-7 miles  
Monday mornings: long runs (Sundays will help so I get used to running on fatigued legs)  
Wednesday mornings: tempo runs  
Friday mornings: speed work

While I like running on Thursdays, it makes it hard to fit in three days a week without relying too much on weekends. 

These are the long runs I have on tap:  
week of 7/10 (M-6): 20 miles @ 8:42 (!!!)  
Week of 7/17 (M-5): 15 miles @ 8:32. Relay Fri/Sat (18miles),  
Week of 7/24 (M-4): recovery &#8211; 8 miles?  
Week of 7/31 (M-3): 20miles @ 8:27  
Week of 8/7 (M-2): 13miles @ 8:12  
Week of 8/14: 10 miles @8:12, RACE SAT/SUN!
