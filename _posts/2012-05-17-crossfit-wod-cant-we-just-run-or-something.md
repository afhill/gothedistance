Yes, that&#8217;s what was running through my mind as I threw a 10 lb medicine ball against the wall, 4 feet above my head. Again&#8230;and again&#8230; and again&#8230;

Today was an interesting WOD, full of exercises I hadn&#8217;t attempted before. None of which I was particularly good at&#8230; 

>   1. 5-4-3-2-1 strict press
>   2. AMRAP in 22min 
>       * 10 wall ball
>       * 10 slam ball
>       * 10 knees to elbow

Even the warmup was novel: we did a warmup row based on calorie burn, not distance. It didn&#8217;t impact the workout significantly, it was just &#8220;different&#8221;.

The strict press went well; I worked with Loren. We weren&#8217;t sure what to start with (we were supposed to be working up to our 1RM). There is a crazy fit girl who&#8217;s been to the last few classes and she said her 1RM was 80, so we decided to work up to 70-something. We started with 50 lbs and worked our way up. Ended with 1 rep at 75. Tried another rep at 80, no dice, but that means we worked our weights just right in the increments we increased by. 

Then came the actual workout.. as prescribed, gals should use a 14lbs medicine ball and hit the wall 9ft up. I tried one throw and knew that weight would be too much, so I went down to 10lbs. It was still awkward and my first rep took me 14 attempts to hit the target 10 times.  
The slam balls weren&#8217;t too bad, I used a 20lb ball. My right ankle was complaining a bit with the deep squats, which seems a little weird to me.  
The knees to elbows was ok, I made good contact but Leo said I was swaying too much and to try to just drive my knees up and down rather than swinging. I tried to work on my technique but struggled with it. 

This one was TOUGH! I had to just let my competitive spirit go as I was lapped by others. I got better at wall balls as time went on (although I could tell I was favoring my right side to throw with), until about my 6th round when I managed to let the ball bounce off my head and roll away. 

This was definitely a tough workout for me. Leo kept saying &#8220;pace yourself, it&#8217;s not a sprint&#8221;. It&#8217;s tough for me to not try to muscle through a set though.. definitely something for me to work on. However.. he then said it was like a 5K, and for me that&#8217;s pretty close to a sprint!! 

In the end, I finished 8 rounds and 28 reps. Not anything great, but it was good to do something different. Driving home, I could definitely feel it in my shoulders and arms! 

I realized before the workout started that I&#8217;ve done a ton of running the past few days (9 Tues night w/ intervals, 5 Wed morning, 6.5 last night at tempo pace) and I will be GLAD not to run today and just let my system recover from some hard efforts. Although when I was throwing that silly medicine ball, all I wanted was to do some nice familiar pavement-pounding&#8230;

The crazy fit girl is really nice, too. She encourages others, and when someone new was in the class she went over and introduced herself. It&#8217;s really nice to see someone (a girl&#8230;) who is doing some great work AND encouraging others. It&#8217;s probably something I could stand to be better at myself. It&#8217;s way better than having that secret envy/competitive streak against someone who&#8217;s awesome. She&#8217;s nice, so I WANT her to do well! It doesn&#8217;t diminish the work I&#8217;m doing myself.
