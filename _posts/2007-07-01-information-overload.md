Got my garmin and went to set it this morning. Whoa!!!!! There are so many options, I am completely overwhelmed. The good thing is that you can set numerous.. profiles?.. so I don&#8217;t have to choose just one configuration. The screen can have up to four panes on it, and you can select what you want to display: time, date, average pace, overall pace, pace per lap, best pace, slowest pace, heart rate, best heart rate, worst heart rate, average heart rate, heart rate zone, time, etc etc etc. What to choose? I honestly wonder if there is some sort of garmin community that suggests configurations. I assume I will make a few different profiles based on the type of workout. However it goes, it will be fun to try out some different setups!
