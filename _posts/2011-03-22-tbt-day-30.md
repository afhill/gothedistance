I&#8217;m a little worried I&#8217;m fighting off something, I&#8217;ve been tired and feeling congested the past couple days. But I feel the odwalla and airborne helped! 

Today was day 30, so at the gym I asked if I could check my body fat. I think I broke my scale in the move so I had to guess at my weight, but it came in at 15.4%. That&#8217;s down from 16.2 a month ago. I understand these numbers can fluctuate, but I&#8217;m still happy to see that progress. I also want to take day 30 pics, but considering I&#8217;m writing this while eating, I may wait for another day.. ðŸ™‚
