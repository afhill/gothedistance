..and none too soon!

Following the McMillan training plan has been good. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve logged more miles than ever before, at an overall faster pace. 

The first time I did the Pfitzinger plan (in preparation for Steamtown 05, where I set an 8min PR), I felt the biggest benefit was mentally getting used to 12 mile mid-week runs. When I hit mile 14 on race day, I knew that 12 miles was nothing to complete. 

With the McMillan plan, the overall pace was faster. It got to a point where I&#8217;d set out for 8 or 9 miles at an 8:15-8:45 pace several times a week and not think twice about it. I&#8217;ve simply become tougher. Last night I ran a &#8220;fast finish long run&#8221; (16 miles total &#8211; 9:19, 9:13, 9:05, 8:59, 8:57, 8:55, 8:54, 8:41, 8:42, 8:23, 7:42, 7:48, 7:34, 7:35, 7:25) at 7pm after not really eating or hydrating as well as I could have. I just set out and did it. 

Yesterday I was talking to my Mom and she mentioned needing Gu for the race. I realized that I haven&#8217;t used Gu all training period! For the first time ever, I&#8217;ve been carrying a sports drink (Cytomax, orange or tropical fruit), but I haven&#8217;t been using Gu. I will come race day, which hopefully will give me yet another edge. 

So mentally, I&#8217;ve gotten used to setting out at a faster speed, run after run. I believe my heart rate has adapted as well, although arguably I haven&#8217;t been doing heart monitor training. My long run last night had an average pace of 8:26, with 6 miles at race pace, and my average heart rate was 162. I&#8217;ve seen changes physically, too. My legs have always been big, but in the past few months they&#8217;ve just exploded with muscle. I&#8217;m pleased: if they have to be big, they may as well be an indication of strength.

The past week has been tough: I&#8217;m used to a three week taper and I was ready for it! Actually yesterday I wasn&#8217;t feeling well, and worried I was getting sick. Interestingly enough, my head hurt for the first 8 or 9 miles yesterday and then cleared up when I kicked it into high gear! So much for long runs negatively affecting your immune system!

So&#8230; two weeks to Phoenix, wow! As I ease back on the running I know I need to really be sure to stay healthy, and keep my &#8216;eyes on the prize&#8217;. I have worked too hard to let myself talk myself out of achieving what I want to!
