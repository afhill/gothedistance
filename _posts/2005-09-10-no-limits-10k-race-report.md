Today was the RunWildRacing No Limits 10K. For whatever reason, I wasn&#8217;t that excited about racing today. Doug had decided to run as well, which helped alot. We ran together for most of the course, til about a half mile to go, when I told him to let loose. The course itself was pretty, although it WAS challenging (as it had been billed) &#8211; there were some decent hills, you ran up over the dam and onto grass for over a mile, and then on the 4th mile you actually had to run up the stairs to the top of the dam! I missed my PR by 8 seconds, which wasn&#8217;t a big deal as this was a pretty tough course. Still brought home some hardware; I was 6/53 for the women and first in my age group.

**edit:** just realized I didn&#8217;t even post my time: 47:59. Mile splits were 8:00, 7:48, 7:55, (two miles I didn&#8217;t check), 6:58 (!!). The last .2 was through a parking lot, and I didn&#8217;t push it that hard. I was just glad to be done.
