THis weekend was so great for running, I wasn&#8217;t even that concerned about the final VO2 Max workout:  
_8 mi w/ 3 x 1,600 m @ 5K race pace (7:04); jog 2 min between_ 

200m: :52/:53  
400m: 1:44  
1600m: 6:56

Ran 9 laps to warmup-

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0" width="300px">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>repeat (400m)</b>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <b>split time</b>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <b>(lap avg)</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      1
    </td>
    
    <td>
      1:39, 1:42, 1:40, 1:38
    </td>
    
    <td>
      6:39
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      2
    </td>
    
    <td>
      1:34, 1:38, 1:38,1:39
    </td>
    
    <td>
      6:29
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      3
    </td>
    
    <td>
      1:37, 1:43, 1:41, 1:43
    </td>
    
    <td>
      6:44
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Then another 9 to cooldown.

I actually felt pretty good in the first two repeats, although after the 2nd I felt I&#8217;d gone into a pretty deep anaerobic state and had to stop completely after running, I didn&#8217;t feel well. I did start the third repeat only 2:15 later, but I could tell that I pushed a little hard (unintentionally). The first lap of the last repeat I felt pretty crappy, but forced myself to keep going. I was actually surprised that first lap wasn&#8217;t slow. After than I eased up and just finished, not worrying about pushing myself too hard.

Overall, I was a bit quicker than my &#8216;goal&#8217; pace. I know doing these too hard is counter-productive, but I feel good about it. My legs feel great, I feel this was completely an exercise for my lungs. 

Bring it on!!!
