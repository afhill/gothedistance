This morning I met with my trainer. We did a variety of exercises but I&#8217;d say overall the focus is really on core stability. I did everything from box jumps and romanian deadlifts to horizontal pull-ups and hip flexor stuff. I&#8217;d say my favorite was the pushups/tucks with my feet suspended in the TRX machine. I actually laughed when she showed me because I anticipated it&#8217;d be fun. 

I used the foam roller after the workout, but as the day went on my glutes and hip flexors got increasingly tight. By the time I got to practice, my legs were feeling the effect of yesterday&#8217;s workout. They weren&#8217;t sore, just tired, and I didn&#8217;t have the quick movement that I like to have at derby. I didn&#8217;t let it affect me too much though, because I felt great both Sunday and Tuesday. I know I&#8217;ll be solid for our bout on Saturday. It is just funny how the day after a good workout you don&#8217;t feel the immediate benefits, only the soreness. Good thing we forget this before the next time we&#8217;re supposed to work out!

#### Food

  * 6:00 &#8211; Whole wheat english muffin with pb 
  * 7:30 &#8211; Banana
  * 7:45 &#8211; Smoothie: egg whites, kefir, oatmeal, kale, orange, frozen berries, flax seed, wheat germ, hemp protein powder, glutamine after workout
  * 8:10 &#8211; Apple as I left the gym
  * 8:10 &#8211; Tea as I left the gym
  * 9:30 &#8211; Quinoa, low-fat milk, dates
  * 11:30-Hummus and whole wheat pita chips
  * 12:45 &#8211; Spinach salad with mango, tomato, tofu, macadamia nuts
  * 3:00 &#8211; Apple with pb
  * 4:30 &#8211; Fruitien protein shake with milk (not clean)
  * 6:30 &#8211; Butternut squash empanada
  * 6:45 &#8211; Dried apple slices
  * 10:00 &#8211; Probar superfood slam
  * 10:20 &#8211; My first attempt at bean pupusas. Not good

#### Exercise

  * One hour personal training: 
      * floor work: fire hydrants, caterpillars, lunges, other hip flexor stuff
      * Box jumps
      * romanian deadlifts, hamstring/hip work
      * TRX pushups and curls, swiss ball rotations
      * horizontal pullups, other cable work
      * weighted lunges, monster walk
      * other stuff I can&#8217;t recall or describe
  * three hours derby: 2 hr scrimmage, 1 hr team practice

I was feeling sluggish, possibly also food related. I was just feeling &#8220;off&#8221; today. I think I&#8217;ll take tomorrow as a well-deserved rest day!

I took my creatine before and after derby with coconut water, which I think is a good compromise with the &#8216;sweetened beverage&#8217; thing. 

oh, I weighed myself at the gym this morning. 113.4. Supposedly this creatine can lead to weight gain, let&#8217;s see what happens!
