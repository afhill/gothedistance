This week saw a series of setbacks, but thankfully they seem to be more or less over. A week after twisting my ankle last Sunday, there is still some swelling there, although it feels fine. It did cause me to take it easy this week, however. Then I caught a bug that knocked me out on Thursday. Still, it was a decent week and I managed to meet my monthly (somewhat soft) goal!

Mon: day off

Tues: easy run around the neighbourhood: 1.25 miles. AvgHR 149, MaxHR 171

Wed: Good treadmill run in the am: 2 miles @ 7:35 pace. AvgHR 166, MaxHR 188

Thurs: sick! Left work at noon, slept all afternoon

Fri: headache subsided, but still sniffly and weak

Sat: got up to meet the BRC/Runners Edge group, decided it was too gorgeous a day to run with a pack. Ran close to home: 6 miles @ 9:53 pace. AvgHR 151, MaxHR 162

Sun: again, woke up and considered driving to Colo Springs; decided against it. Found a new trail in my Run the Rockies book and went and did [Carpenter Peak](http://www.travelblog.org/North-America/United-States/Colorado/blog-250744.html). Covered the snowy 6.5 miles in 1:18:49. AvgHR 148 MaxHR 173.

Total weekly miles: 15.75 miles  
Monthly mileage: 103.56 (note: last week was off! Hurray!)

I still have plans to get in those 20 miles per weekend.. just not this weekend ðŸ™‚
