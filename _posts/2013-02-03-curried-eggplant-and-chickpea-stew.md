Last Spring, my friend KJ and I would have &#8220;Marathon Movie Mondays&#8221; where we&#8217;d make dinner together and watch running movies. It was fun to try out some different recipes and hang out. It&#8217;s been far too long since we spent time together, so tonight I invited her over for dinner. I tried a recipe from my &#8220;Supermarket Vegan&#8221; cookbook &#8211; [Curried Eggplant and Chickpea Stew](http://books.google.com/books?id=T5KxjCQhc-8C&q=curried+eggplant#v=onepage&q=%22curried%20eggplant%20and%20black-eyed%20pea%20stew%22&f=false). (Note: the recipe is actually Curried Eggplant and Black-eyed Pea Stew but it says you can substitute chickpeas for black-eyed peas, so I did).

The longest part of the whole process was salting the cubed eggplant and letting it sit. I wasn&#8217;t aware of that little tip to draw out the bitterness from eggplant! The recipe was pretty straightforward: put the eggplant and onion in a skillet, stir. Add garlic, stir. Add chickpeas, curry powder, veggie broth, chili sauce, stir. Simmer. Add cilantro and mango chutney, stir. The recipe had also suggested adding raisins, which we decided would have been a nice addition. 

I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would be &#8211; the eggplant didn&#8217;t look super appetizing and I felt like there should have been more sauce, but it actually turned out really well! The mango chutney added a really nice sweetness to the stew without being overpowering.

This is the first recipe I&#8217;ve made from this cookbook, but I&#8217;m really excited about it. The recipes seem pretty simple and don&#8217;t have a lot of really complicated ingredients.
