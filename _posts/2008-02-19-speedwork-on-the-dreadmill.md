1mi cooldown at 9:13 &#8211; avgHR 164, maxHR 171

For anyone counting (and assuming I copied correctly from my Garmin), that&#8217;s 10 miles in 1:23:23. Average HR &#8211; 168, Max HR 185.

It actually felt pretty good. Initially the half mile intervals felt too long, but I was appreciating them nearer the end! I may look next week to doing 6:45s. Another variation may be to shorten the recovery intervals, but then I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;d be able to pull off quite so many miles!
