Wow. 

The nicest weather they&#8217;ve had for years for the Buckeye Trail 50K &#8211; Winter Edition. It was in the 30s/40s. Almost no ice or snow at all on the trail. But what did that leave? MUD. An incredible amount of sticky, ooosy gooshy mud. Mud that caused you to slide down hills, that caused my heel to actually raise out of my shoe on one ocassion, and threatened to do so more than that. I actually stopped at mile 18 to swap out shoes; both are absolutely caked in mud.

I&#8217;ll write up a formal report later. But this thing took for-EVER. I actually ended up stopping at the marathon point simply because I knew the last five miles would take me at least an hour and a quarter to finish (probably more).

Because yes, the 26.2miles I ran today took me a cool 6:10:03. Yes. 6:10:03. A third longer than I have ever been on my feet before. 

It was fun, it was a challenge. But running practically non-stop from 7am &#8211; 1:10pm is a wee bit extreme! (for now, at least)
