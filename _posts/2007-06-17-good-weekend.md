Yesterday I went out to meet the gang at Highbanks. It was a smallish group: Bridget, Junior, Mike, Bob and I. I ran with Mike and Bob. We &#8216;took it slow&#8217; since Bob just had back surgery in April and the six mile loop was to be his longest since the surgery. I was glad, since I&#8217;d been out the night before and didn&#8217;t sleep that well. As I headed into the final section, I looked at my watch and saw 46:xx. Generally we run the loop in about 51, so I decided to pick it up. I came in at 49:55, pretty good for me. I had considered doing another half loop, but none of us were that motivated once we stopped. I spent the rest of the day relaxing: went on the boat, had a four hour (!) nap. 

This morning I got up and ready for my first 5K run in a looooong time. I knew my PR was a 7:05 pace, but I figured I would be happy with a 7:30 average. The run was an out and back, with a pretty small crowd. I lined up near the front of the women and quickly settled into third place for women overall. I hit the first mile marker at 6:59, oops! The leader passed me on his way back when I was about 9 minutes in. I stopped to walk a few paces at the turnaround, where they were handing out water. I know a walk break shouldn&#8217;t be necessary in a 5K, but for whatever reason it seems to for me. The fourth place girl passed me, but as soon as I started again I passed her easily. Ahead, I saw the second place girl catching up with the girl in first place. I then pulled up to be in second place myself. I was surprised to pass the mile 2 marker with 6:39 on my watch! The girl in first dropped her headband or something, I picked it up and carried it the last mile. For a moment I considered trying to put on the jets to catch up with her but I figured that would wear me out. I chugged along for the last mile, although I did have to stop to walk for a small time (ugh, something to get past!) As I neared the finish, I knew I wouldn&#8217;t catch the girl in first, but I was content with second. I stopped my watch with an overall time of 21:53 (the official results say 21:55). I was content with that, but for some reason my recollection of my past 5K times was off and I had in my mind that this really wasn&#8217;t a great time for me. 

I finished the race, gave the first place girl her headband and told her I&#8217;d thought about trying to catch her during the race, but figured I&#8217;d just wait til the end to give it back to her. She told me I could have caught her (she ended up finishing only 8 seconds before me). As we chatted, someone asked to take our photo, so who knows where that will show up!

I grabbed an apple (I&#8217;ve decided I really like apples after races) and headed home. A few hours later I was thinking about the average pace, and realized that no&#8230; I think [I just PRed](http://www.afhill.com/running/races.html).

Uh, yeah. Sure did. Even with the official time, I came in with a 7:04 pace. Not bad for no official short race training! I&#8217;ll admit I was a little nervous heading out to the race, but I think that&#8217;s just a sign that I should think about doing some more short races this year!
