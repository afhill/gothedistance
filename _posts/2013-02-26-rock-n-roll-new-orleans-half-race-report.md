I felt good after the Jan race, and got back up to 50MPW quickly. I felt strong and was excited to run, but just didn&#8217;t have the same focus for the race. I told a few people I&#8217;d like to run well, but I didn&#8217;t feel the drive. I&#8217;ve been extremely busy with school and work and just didn&#8217;t have the extra energy to focus on the race. As it was, I brought along my work laptop and my finance textbook because I knew my long weekend would have to include some work and studying.

I was pleasantly surprised by New Orleans. In my mind it was just Bourbon St and flooded streets, but I really enjoyed the river walk and the French Quarter. I stayed with Eddie and we got together with Doug and his family for lunch on Sat after the expo. I&#8217;d received access to the Regency Club which had breakfast, coffee, snacks and hors d&#8217;oeuvres. Eddie and I had a couple glasses of wine Sat night, and then I snuck in my last pre-race workout on the treadmill. I felt decent but I just wasn&#8217;t in a race frame of mind. As I headed off to bed I recalled how for AZ I&#8217;d so carefully looked up my target splits and had them ready. I knew I was in good shape physically but I wasn&#8217;t in the game mentally.

In the morning I felt less energetic than I sometimes do. We headed to the start where I was pleasantly surprised by the weather, it was perfect! I brought along my iPhone as I had in AZ but I&#8217;d changed my playlists have more slower songs-perhaps an odd strategy, but I had decided I really wanted to avoid the crash I&#8217;d had at mile 8 in AZ. We said good bye near the corrals and I did a little warmup on my own. Soon enough it was time to go!

I started out feeling good, but glanced at my watch at one point and saw 0.6 and was shocked. Id felt like I was running too fast? This was going to be a long slow run! A few seconds later I realized I was at 1.6 miles, there just has been no Mile 1 marker. The course was quite pretty, and there was an out-and-back that let us see the elites cruise by. I was enjoying the race and looking around when I stepped on a rough patch of road and tweaked my left ankle. #\*_}75%\*!?! Always my left ankle&#8230; I jogged over to the side of the course and slowed down a bit,but it was nothing too serious. Then a quarter mile later my right shoe came undone. I&#8217;m sure if this were an important race for me I&#8217;d have pushed harder through these roadblocks but instead I took them as a sign that this maybe wasn&#8217;t my day. My ankle incident did make me much more cautious for the rest of the run.

M1: 6:50  
M2: 6:54  
M3: 6:53  
M4: 6:50

I was still feeling strong, though, and enjoyed the run. I didn&#8217;t worry about my mile splits and just let myself run as I felt. I was a bit disturbed by the fluids on the course- the stops were about every 2 miles and there was no Gatorade at the first station.. I actually didn&#8217;t get anything bc I&#8217;d bee waiting for Gatorade. I was more proactive in taking Gu and got some around mile 5, but trying to take it and drink seemed to throw me off. I honestly think I&#8217;m getting out of practice with taking Gu and I may need to start going it again (or finding an alternative fuel source).

M5: 7:10  
M6: 6:55  
M7: 7:01

I definitely didn&#8217;t bonk like I did in AZ, but I also just really didn&#8217;t push. Around mile 8 was where Jay had told me to pick it up,but I just didn&#8217;t feel like it. I was enjoying the run and didn&#8217;t want to put that pressure on myself. Perhaps because I didn&#8217;t have an execution plan that would give me confidence to run a particular time, I just didn&#8217;t feel motivated to push. As a result, miles 8-10 were a little boring as I just wanted to be done. I did take some more Gu around mile 9, but unfortunately grabbed Gatorade instead of water (here was the Gatorade!!) and ended up with sickly sweetness all over my fingers and in my mouth. Ew. (Looking at my splits after the fact, I think that&#8217;s what accounts for the big slow-down)

M8: 7:00  
M9: 7:20  
M10: 7:01

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4460" alt="hillguy" src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hillguy-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hillguy.jpg)I kept running and actually felt pretty good around mile 10 (imagine that, after easing off the gas the last 3 miles!) I debated picking it up a bit but refrained from looking at my watch and just ran by feel. Then the next thing I knew there was a mile to go and I decided it was time to go. I fixed my eyes on a girl ahead of me and chased her down. The marathoners and half-marathoners split off at 12.6 and while I was happy to nearly be done, I also knew I hadn&#8217;t run anything of great achievement today. I DID enjoy it, though! I liked the end of course, which wound around in a park and then the finish line was just ahead! I kicked it up and a guy I caught up with said &#8220;let&#8217;s do it&#8221; so we raced in to the thrill of the crowd. He did outkick me right at the end, and I was amused to see his shirt &#8220;I conquered the hill&#8221;.

M11: 7:19  
M12: 7:24  
M13: 6:41

I came in at 1:32:26, my second-fastest half marathon. I felt no emotional disappointment for not running a PR&#8230; Although I know I am physically fit, I didn&#8217;t bring my mental game today. I learned a lot from the race- for one thing I remembered how it can be fun to just run a race without feeling like I have anything to prove. I also learned how different it feels to have race focus vs not, and saw clearly the impact it can have on finish time. I gained a lot of confidence to know that I can run this time really without trying hard, and I know I have the capability to run much faster when I&#8217;m focused. **Now it&#8217;s just a atter of identifying those A and B races and seeing how each can contribute to what I want to accomplish.** I still haven&#8217;t mastered the in-race progression, in part because in a race I think I am too focused on a particular finish time. I plan to work on that in the future.

In all, I really loved NOLA. I just wish the roads were better as I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s a great race. I thought the course was pretty, it was logistically run well, but I didn&#8217;t like having to watch my footing. I spoke with friends and strangers alike (I stop and talk with folks wearing race gear for days after the race) and EVERYONE mentioned the challenges with the rough footing. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the course is flat and at sea level if you have to step gingerly.

I&#8217;ve had a few friends text me anxiously about the race &#8211; the fact is, it reminds me of how I used to approach events: I enjoyed seeing a new city by foot! In the past 5 weeks I&#8217;ve had two wonderful race experiences: one of focus and drive, and one of the pure joy of our sport. It&#8217;s a balance I&#8217;ve really missed lately, and I&#8217;m glad to have it back. To know I can push myself and achieve my goals, but that not every event needs to be better than the last.

And with a happy heart and not-beat-up legs and lungs, it&#8217;s onto the next one!
