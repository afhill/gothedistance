I recently heard there was a question if I was &#8220;doing the Frida/Queen thing&#8221; &#8211; referring to the [90 Day Total Body Transformation](http://90daytbt.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/day-one-its-now-or-never/) Frida Beater and Queen Elizabitch from RMRG have taken on. 

The quick answer is no, I&#8217;m not. I would definitely say I&#8217;m not doing 5 days a week of intense exercise! But I am interested in the diet piece of what they&#8217;re doing, so I&#8217;ve been following along. I&#8217;ve been blessed with never really having to worry about my weight, but I know I could stand to be eating healthier. I started tracking what I&#8217;m eating to &#8220;encourage&#8221; me to do so. 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Chipotle-Nutrition-Facts-Calculator-2-198x300.jpg" alt="" title="Chipotle Nutrition Facts Calculator 2" width="198" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1438" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Chipotle-Nutrition-Facts-Calculator-2.jpg)In retrospect, I should have started tracking before trying to be healthy, I think the before and after would have been pretty remarkable. When we were skating up in Brighton, I had a bad habit of swinging by [Del Taco](http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/nutrition-calories/food/del-taco/big-fat-chicken-taco-5.4-oz./) after practices some nights. Once I was on the phone with a teammate and she heard me ordering. She exclaimed, &#8220;you eat fast food??&#8221;. I guess it&#8217;s a complement that she was surprised by it! I also have cut my coffee intake down to about once a week, whereas for awhile there I was probably having coffee every morning and 3 or 4 afternoons a week. And by coffee, I mean coffee with sweetened creamer, or, heaven forbid, a grande hazelnut white mocha at Starbucks! I&#8217;ve never been much of a soda drinker (except with Chipotle or Chinese food), but I&#8217;ve dropped that too. Oh&#8230; yeah&#8230; Chipotle. I may also have had Chipotle a lot of Wednesdays as my pre-scrimmage food! Here&#8217;s the nutritional info for my favorite meal, which was sometimes also supplemented with chips and guac too!

I&#8217;m still struggling with meals, having practice or meetings several nights a week doesn&#8217;t lend itself well to good meals. However, with eating more frequently and eating smaller portions, I&#8217;m more able to regulate my intake. Oh &#8211; part of what I have been really trying to get into is &#8220;[eating clean](http://www.eatcleandiet.com/)&#8220;. Eating more frequent, smaller meals, combining complex carbs with lean proteins and avoiding processed foods. 

A few other significant changes may have come from my upping my calcium significantly. A few months ago I read a book on [Training and Nutrition](http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Track-Training-Nutrition-Americas/dp/1594860130) from a top female runner where the virtues of cottage cheese were extolled. I hated cottage cheese as a kid, and even as recently as a few years ago, but I&#8217;ve definitely incorporated it into my diet now.

When I go home to Edmonton, I also always visit a naturopath. He gave me some oils (hemp seed, salmon), b-vitamins and intestinal cleaning stuff to take. I&#8217;ve been really diligent in doing this &#8211; as he said, it does no good to sit in the cupboard (as it has been since last time I saw him). 

Combined, I think all this has lead to my weight loss and toning up. While I was doing more high-intensity running leading up to the marathon, I haven&#8217;t done much lately but I haven&#8217;t seen the scale creep back up. I really just think I&#8217;m feeding my body quality fuel and it&#8217;s responding to it. 

I am going to try to do more strength training as I know that&#8217;s an area I&#8217;m lacking in. I develop muscle pretty quickly and all I&#8217;ve got is pretty sports-specific.
