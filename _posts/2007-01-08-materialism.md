So I have been coveting the [garmin 305](http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Receiver-Heart-Monitor/dp/B000CSWCQA/sr=8-1/qid=1168290910/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-4323844-7923136?ie=UTF8&s=electronics) for awhile.. my Mom got the 205, and raved about it. As Christmas approached, I _kept_ eying the darned thing. 

Then I got a nice little &#8220;cash award&#8221; from work &#8212; we don&#8217;t have Christmas bonuses, but for the past two years, I&#8217;ve received a &#8220;cash award&#8221; right at the end of the year. This year&#8217;s was several hundred dollars, which definitely helped me think more about the garmin. 

However, I was prudent and just priced out the toy before the money came through, rather than buying it to pay off when the funds came through. And I nicely forgot that &#8216;cash awards&#8217; are taxed at forty-some percent. **üôÅ** And then I had some crazy big house expenses come in. **double- üôÅ**. That doesn&#8217;t stop me from looking longingly at the listing on amazon, wishing I hadn&#8217;t been prudent, and would now just be cursing my visa bill, but with a fancy new accessory on my arm. 

I&#8217;d considered adopting Meredith&#8217;s &#8220;reward&#8221; system, where for every mile I run, I earn &#8220;points&#8221; towards buying something like this. But then I get impatient that it&#8217;ll take so long to &#8216;earn&#8217; the points. Wow, am I really that spoiled???
