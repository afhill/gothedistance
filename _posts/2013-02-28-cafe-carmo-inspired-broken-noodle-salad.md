I have a confession to make: I&#8217;m a veg*n who doesn&#8217;t like lettuce. I actually used to joke that that&#8217;s part of why I became vegetarian: it forces me to eat healthy things I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily choose. 

It also means I get pretty excited when I find a non-lettuce-based salad option, which I did last week at [Cafe Carmo](http://cafecarmo.com/) in New Orleans.

(Incidentally: vegan food in NOLA may be few and far between, but Cafe Carmo makes up for it!)

Today I decided to recreate their Broken Noodle salad at home. Sadly the grocery store was out of bean sprouts, but I was a little creative with what I had in the fridge.

The restaurant lists the ingredients as: Rice noodles with tofu, peanuts, bean sprouts, cucumber, peas, mushrooms, cabbage, cilantro, peppers & scallions all tossed with citrus ginger chili vinaigrette.

My version: Glass noodles with tofu, peanuts, peas, mushrooms, spinach, yellow pepper, avocado and cilantro, with a ginger-lime olive oil. Dang &#8211; just now I see theirs said chili vinaigrette, I totally could have done that as I have a few different chili oils. 

I made the noodles in advance and had them chilling in the fridge, which made the salad a little cooler than I may have liked. As well, the dressing didn&#8217;t have the kick it could have. In all, though, it was tasty and quick &#8211; and lettuce-free!!
