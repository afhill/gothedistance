**Monday**  
Plan: 8mi w/ 10x100m strides (after buying NEW SHOES!!!!)  
Actual: bought the new shoes, as well as a knee sleeve. Headed out to Highbanks at 5pm. It was extremely hot, as in 92F, and humid. I still managed to eek out about 5 miles, and pounded up several of the hills as my &#8216;strides&#8217;. I actually find hillwork not too bad when it&#8217;s hot, I suppose because your heart rate is already elevated. I only did 5 miles, because I was hot and was under time constraints. Told myself I&#8217;d finish another three later in the evening. After gatorade and plenty of water, several hours later I still felt overheated. I started to get a headache like I have after races now and then, so I called it a day.  
Mileage: 5mi daily, 5mi for the week

**Tuesday**  
rest

**Wednesday**  
Plan: 9mi (w/ Meredith)  
Actual: 9 sweaty miles with Meredith. We met (in the dark) at 5:45 at New Albany High School. She took me on an 8 mile tour of new Albany, which was nice, even if I was completely disoriented. I was carrying a ater bottle, which I&#8217;m not really used to, but it was definitely good to have! A few times I felt tired, but we kept pushing. We had set to run eight miles on a path, then a last mile on the track, and coming back to the school (1:11), I didn&#8217;t think I was going to do that last mile, but we took it nice and slow and it was ok. My knee twinged a little around mile 7.5, but overall it felt ok. It was great to get so much accomplished before 7am, and it was good to chat with her! Our weekly runs together haven&#8217;t really happened in awhile.  
Mileage: 9mi daily, 14mi for the week

**Thursday**  
rest

**Friday**  
Plan: recovery 4mi  
Actual: Managed to enjoy the cooler temperatures this morning, ran 3 times around the neighbourhood (~1.5miles per loop). The first loop, I didn&#8217;t have on my knee sleeve thingy, and my knee was sore. I stopped to get it after the first lap, and my knee felt better afterwards, although there was an odd twinge in my shin when I started running. I bought size small, although my calves are huge, and I think it may be a little tight. I actually rolled up the bottom of it, which felt fine, and told myself that it looked more like the cho-pad (sp?) bands, so it was probably even better for me ðŸ™‚  
Mileage: 4.5 today, 18.5 for the week

**Saturday**  
Plan: 13 miles  
Actual: Met the gang at 7am at Antrim park. We quickly splintered off into a few groups, and I ran with Meredith and some new guy, Tony. It&#8217;s obviously been awhile since I&#8217;ve run with people, because I kept elbowing Meredith. We went north from the lake, and the first half took us 1:05. When we got back to the lake, Mike made some comment about how slow we were going, but it felt comfortable. We set off south, and I decided to run 14 as that&#8217;s what everyone else was going for (except the folks who had 18 planned, but they were well ahead of us). Although we started the second half with Doug, Bob, Mike, Christy, Meredith and I, we ended up with MEredith and I on our own again. We were racing the last half mile, and finished in 57:xx. Nice! Felt good for most of it, although with about 2 miles to go, Andy asked me how my knee was feeling, and it started to tingle. Overall, felt good though!  
Mileage: 14 today, 32.5 for the week

**Sunday**
