Today I met [Meredith](meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/) and [Dave](notesandlines.blogspot.com/) for our last midweek &#8220;Long&#8221; run before Boston. It was gorgeous out, Meredith and I both wore tanks and shorts. We had 7 miles on the schedule, and Dave had a 90 min run (he&#8217;s in training for his first half Ironman). Our standard route is about 6 miles, so we just went on past where we were parked til we hit 7, and then we decided to run back with Dave, rather than walk. So overall we ran 7.85. As we were going (at a decent 9:29 average pace on the warmest day on the year thus far), I mentioned that I hated taper, as I just didn&#8217;t feel &#8220;right&#8221; (my knees were a bit sore). I&#8217;d been thinking about the age of my shoes, and Meredith even said &#8220;do you think it could be because you&#8217;ve run 500 miles this year???&#8221; 

I knew it was a sign when I input my miles into LogYourRun, and IT even pointed this out. &#8220;Please update your shoes&#8221;??? Now, I know that not all those miles are on this particular pair of shoes. But yes, the computer guilt trip was enough to make me pull out the credit card. 

I&#8217;ve been wearing saucony omnis for a few years now. It used to be the omni moderate 5, then I went up to the omni moderate 6, and then the last pair I bought (on sale) were omni ultimate 5, extra narrow. They seemed just fine, so I just ordered a couple more pair. I plan to actually put on different shoelaces for each and seriously track the mileage on each of them. I&#8217;ve heard that it takes over 24hours for shoes to &#8220;recover/decompress&#8221; after a run, and that two pairs of shoes worn on alternate days will last longer than three pairs worn one after another. So I&#8217;m going to actually try to do the alternating, and track the miles on each. Since it appears LogYourRun wants to do it anyway&#8230;.<br clear="all" />
