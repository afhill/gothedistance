Again today, I ran in the morning, and I feel great. Why is it so hard to get out there? Oh wait, because 5am comes really early. Today I worked from home and I wanted to run outside, so I waited until 7 and just did an easy 4 miles close to home. Afterwards, I just felt a wonderful giddiness. I just really need to take the time, even just a half hour or 45 min a day&#8230;
