Today we did a ladder workout: 

warmup, then 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1 minutes.  
1+2 minutes at 5-10K pace  
3+4 minutes at 10K-HMP  
5minutes at HMP

The point of the ladder was also so that you were faster on the way down. 

Before we even started, Darren confirmed that those paces were just guidelines and it was ok to go faster as long as you didn&#8217;t blow up on the way down ðŸ™‚

my paces, for reference &#8211;  
5K &#8211; 6:25  
10K &#8211; 6:40  
HMP &#8211; 709

How&#8217;d it go? Pretty well, I&#8217;d say!

1 &#8211; 6:05  
2 &#8211; 6:20  
3 &#8211; 6:30  
4 &#8211; 6:39  
5 &#8211; 6:56 &#8211; I actually purposely &#8220;held back&#8221; here to be sure I was strong for the rest  
4 &#8211; 6:51  
3 &#8211; 6:28  
2 &#8211; 6:17  
1 &#8211; 5:58

With our warmup, cooldown and recovery, I ended up with 8.6 miles in 1:09, for an overall 8:04 pace. Average heart rate 160, max 186. 

I ran with Lydia for some of the middle of the workout, it was great to have someone to try to keep pace with. During one of the recovery intervals she asked if I did my long runs in Denver, and said if I ever feel like joining them on a Sunday, I&#8217;m welcome to!
