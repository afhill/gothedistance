Although I eat well, I do take a few supplements. This is what I took today:

#### Supplements

Morning:

  * Vegan multi-vitamin. Not only does it not contain animal product (gelatin or shellfish), it accounts for an animal-free diet. For example, the B12 is really high.
  * Co-Q 10
  * Iron &#8211; I used to take this and calcium in the morning, but they apparently block each other
  * [Extreme Endurance](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/12/my-secret-weapon/)
  * Glucosamine
  * Udo&#8217;s oil &#8211; I was tested by a naturopath once and he even said that Fish oil didn&#8217;t work for me, so I&#8217;ve long taken hemp seed oil. More recently I&#8217;ve decided to try this instead. Because it&#8217;s in the fridge and not with my other supplements, I sometimes forget. Also I don&#8217;t get this when I travel.

Afternoon (when I remember)

  * Extreme Endurance
  * Calcium

#### Food

  * tea
  * steel cut oats with almond butter, hemp seeds, chia seeds and blackberries
  * Green smoothie: supergreens, apple, banana, frozen blueberries, orange, chia seeds, kefir, hemp protein powder, maca, BCAAs and creatine.
  * hummus and multi-seed crackers
  * homemade kombucha
  * raw cashews
  * Vega sports performance optimizer with BCAAs and Creatine
  * multi-seed crackers with my homemade [vegan cashew cheese](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/vegan-cashew-cheese/)
  * black beans, brown rice, tomato, avocado in a whole wheat tortilla
  * greek yogurt with a bit of muesli

#### Exercise

  * 4.75 mile run. Started out ok, then felt crappy, but I got through it. I think this is taper madness!
  * 1 hr deep tissue massage. Yes, I&#8217;m counting this in my &#8220;exercise&#8221; as it&#8217;s body work.
  * [Crossfit basics class](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/crossfit/) (some technique on deadlifts and cleans, some burpees). 
  * </ul> 
    The Crossfit class wasn&#8217;t that much of a workout so I considered doing some more at home after, but then I remembered: I&#8217;m tapering! The last few weeks before a marathon you&#8217;re supposed to take it easy, lower your mileage and not try anything new (whoops!) you&#8217;re supposed to build your energy and heal your body so you&#8217;re ready to go race day.  
    With that in mind, I&#8217;m going to probably tone down my workouts for the next 10 days. Of course for me that just means no two-a-days ðŸ˜‰ but this race is really important to me so I want to do it right!
