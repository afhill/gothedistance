Today&#8217;s big training lesson was about pacing.. or rather, the lesson was that I need to learn about pacing! 

The workout was warmup, then 4 minutes, then 4x90sec, then 4 minutes, then 4&#215;90 sec, then cooldown. I am still learning my place in the group, pace-wise. The first 4 minutes went great. There was a group of about 4 of us together at a decent clip, and then when there was a minute to go I pushed the pace a bit. (Overall: 6:22 average pace)

When we got to the 90 second intervals, I let loose and was up in the top 4 of the entire group.  
Interval 1: 5:46 pace. AvgHR 175, MaxHR 186  
Interval 2: 5:46 pace. AvgHR 177, MaxHR 187  
Interval 3: 5:31 pace. AvgHR 181, MaxHR 188  
Interval 4: 5:56 pace. AvgHR 181, MaxHR 189 (highest point for the entire workout).

Then we had another 4 minutes! I&#8217;d pushed hard to see what sort of speed I had, but wasn&#8217;t able to recover for the rest of the workout. Darren had said that the first 4 minutes was a little fast because it was downhill so we weren&#8217;t necessarily expected to go faster, but still this should be a good strong effort. Whereas the first time I&#8217;d been a mid-packer, I was definitely pulling up the rear by this point. (How sad, at a 6:32 pace??!?!)

And then we had four more 90 second intervals??!! I also have to admit (or use the excuse) that I&#8217;m not a fan of intervals on a narrow path where you have to worry about falling off the side or seeing the right way to go. Running in the dark can be exhilarating, but it&#8217;s dangerous at high speeds. 

Interval 1: 5:43 pace. AvgHR 176, MaxHR 187  
Interval 2: 5:51 pace. AvgHR 175, MaxHR 186  
Interval 3: 5:52 pace. AvgHR 176, MaxHR 186  
Interval 4: 6:01 pace. AvgHR 177, MaxHR 184  
By the last interval I was relegated back to my &#8220;back of pack&#8221; status, with others finishing strong and my puffing like I was dying. But, we were done.

As we headed back to the car, I lamented to some of the other runners that I didn&#8217;t understand why I was able to have speed on the short parts but really struggled during the sustained work. One of them said &#8220;running a few marathons should help that&#8221;. Um, I&#8217;m not sure about that! I think it&#8217;s really just about knowing my limits and running smart. I saw even today how I wasn&#8217;t able to sustain that first burst, so I need to figure out what is sustainable, then steadily push those limits. It&#8217;s not about 2 minute jams anymore! 

Overall: 8.1 miles in 1:06:45
