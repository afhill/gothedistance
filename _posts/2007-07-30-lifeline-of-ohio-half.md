Race results are really quite arbitrary. There can be so many other factors affecting not just our performance, but the results in general. I seem to recall hearing that there is no official &#8220;world record&#8221; for running, just &#8220;world bests&#8221;, because there are so many factors at play. 

Ha, can you see what&#8217;s coming?

So Saturday I ran my slowest ever half marathon. Was the finish time on the clock indicative of my overall fitness, of my skill as a runner? Maybe.. or perhaps it is a better indicator of muggy temperatures and a dramatic raise in mileage over the past few weeks..

I&#8217;m not making excuses &#8211; well, except I suppose I am. But I need to remember: I ran this race near the beginning of a marathon training cycle. I&#8217;d already run 24 miles in the 5 days leading up to the race. I maybe wasn&#8217;t the freshest. In the end, I ran the race since I had 15 miles on my schedule anyway, so I shouldn&#8217;t really see it as &#8216;a race&#8217;. It was a long run, with gatorade provided (warm gatorade, ew!)

I ran the whole way with Doug, which was nice. I will admit that we both danced around the idea of quitting early (it was a two loop course) .&nbsp; We were both thinking about 8 min miles, but it just didn&#8217;t pan out. Oh well, we got our long run in&#8230;

Two weeks into training and I&#8217;m still batting 1000!!!
