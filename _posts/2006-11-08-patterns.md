I said that the Marshall university marathon this weekend reminded me of Sunburst, but I just went back and re-read my race report from that day, and I noticed something else.

Both races were small.  
I set out knowing what time a &#8220;top 10&#8221; female finish was.  
I slowed dramatically at the half way mark. 

Maybe I need to learn to play it smart and run according to MY abilities, not the abilities of those who&#8217;ve run before&#8230;
