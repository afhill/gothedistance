This week I&#8217;m staying with my friend Elyssa in New York. Thursday night she got home from her training run around 9pm, ate and headed to bed so we could get up at 6 for a morning run. After a great 6ish miles, she went to work and in the evening we relaxed because she had her long run on Saturday. This was after she had also run Tuesday and Wednesday as well. 

It occurred to me I miss having a running group, and it&#8217;s just a different frame of mind when you run every day. Sure, I suppose I skate 4-5 days a week, but it just doesn&#8217;t seem the same: running (especially in the morning) just affects my overall well-being and mood moreso than skating, and I just feel like it defines Elyssa and her friends. 

Tonight we talked a bit about recovery: after our run Elyssa jumped in the shower and rushed to work, without really stretching or taking in nutrition for recovery. I&#8217;m impressed she&#8217;s able to run the miles she&#8217;s able to maintain. But I guess you make the time and put in the effort for the things you love. I just struggle talking to runners and wanting to race, knowing I&#8217;m still not putting in the time I should..
