#### Food:

  * Apple
  * 2 apple carrot flax muffins
  * A few bites of Oatmeal, pb, hemp seed
  * Grapes, strawberries, apple
  * Amazing meal
  * Brown rice, steamed spinach, black beans. 
  * a [pluot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluot) I bought at Pike Place Market. Not as wonderous as I hoped it would be
  * Greek yogurt with Ezekiel cereal, hemp seed
  * Banana burrito! Ezekiel wrap, banana, pb, hemp seed
  * Orange
  * Toasted Ezekiel cinnamon raisin english muffin with pb
  * Pb chickpea bar
  * smoked baby clams and falafel chips &#8211; so I read that clams were a good source of iron, and I thought this would be a great snack. BAD CHOICE! So I neglected to check the ingredients: oysters, cottonseed oil, salt. Ok &#8211; first off, are clams and oysters the same thing? Secondly, apparently cottonseed oil is evil. And, they didn&#8217;t even taste good. Booo&#8230;
  * nectarine

Soooo glad to be home where I have good healthy food options! Turns out one cannot live off almonds and old man ears alone (A friend used this to describe dried apricots. What a visual!)  
I admit I&#8217;m becoming a hoarder. We had a client in today and got a fruit/cheese/cracker tray. When the leftovers were available to the staff, I packed away some cheese for my next cheat day (along with the chocolate I hoarded last week!) I figure, if I weren&#8217;t TBTing, I&#8217;d eat it now so it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m really depriving others significantly. 

#### Exercise:

AM: 

  * 7 mile run (controlled heart rate run)

PM:â€‹

  * Leg Extensions: (105lbs &#8211; 15, 12, 10) tough at end!

  * Weighted squats (50lbs &#8211; 15,12,10)
  * Donkey Calf Raises: ( 75lbs â€“ 15, 12, 10) nice and tired after! (ok, during)
  * Glutes (35lbs &#8211; 15,12,10)
  * Lower back (25lbs -3&#215;10)
  * Potty Squats: 5x 1min

I had planned to shoot over to league practice after the gym (my workout ended at 8, about perfect for an 8:30 practice) but decided I needed a bit of time at home to do laundry, etc. Also, last night I got in a good 8hrs of sleep but was still tired. Since I&#8217;m getting up early to go to the gym tomorrow, I decided I didn&#8217;t need to be out too late tonight. I know my nutrition is pretty good but I need to hit the weights to see some real change.

Overall I feel pretty darned good, physically. I have a few minor marks but nothing significant. I wore my padded shorts as per the doc&#8217;s orders and felt good! I definitely know there is more work to be done but I didn&#8217;t necessarily feel like conditioning was a hindrance at all. I AM looking forward to becoming even stronger, though! I don&#8217;t actually remember this specific hit, but this game was tough on me. I&#8217;m still a 112lb jammer!

Oh! And I saw [another TBTer](http://derbygirlstbt.wordpress.com/author/ravenlunachic/) at the gym. She said &#8220;we&#8217;re invading!&#8221; ðŸ™‚
