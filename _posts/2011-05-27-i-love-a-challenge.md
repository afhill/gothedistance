Today my coworker and I went in for a TRX on Tour class at the gym. I wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of the class itself, but at the end the trainers said they were giving away a free TRX to anyone who could complete one of [their challenges](http://www.facebook.com/Trxontour#!/media/set/?set=a.197052610314984.43159.193537600666485): 1) the 40/40 &#8211; 40 atomic pushups, 1 minute rest, 40 rows, or 2) 5 superman fly-out thingys. One guy in our class tried and did the superman one, it was the first time they&#8217;d awarded a prize for it! They were also going to be at the Bolder Boulder Expo so I told them I may try the 40/40 then.. but they encouraged me to give it a try right then. Before I even started, I said I expected I could do a 20/20.. and sure enough, that&#8217;s what I did. The pushups were definitely the challenge moreso than the rows. I don&#8217;t know if the fact I&#8217;d just done an hour workout on the TRX, and I did arms yesterday could have been a factor.. I&#8217;d consider trying it again but I&#8217;m not sure I could do twice as many??

Although I didn&#8217;t really feel it at the time, the workout kinda kicked my butt. I felt it across my chest and lats, and later it was moreso along my lower back and obliques. While I REALLY want to try to meet the challenge, if I can&#8217;t do it this weekend I may work on my own at the gym to eventually make it.

#### Food

  * Smoothie
  * Non-fat dirty Starbucks chai (my boss had 1:1 meetings with each of us
  * apple
  * peanut butter, banana, hemp seed, chia seed sandwich on whole grain bread
  * cottage cheese and raspberries
  * 2 larabars
  * banana
  * mango
  * New Whey Liquid Protein &#8211; I got a few of these at 7-11 after Frida found them. It tasted all right, but then I [googled it when I got home](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=3773321).. I may not bother with this again, as the type of protein is apparently of really low quality. Should have known it was too good to be true!
  * green curry with tofu and brown rice

#### Exercise

  * 45 min TRX session, ended with half the 40/40 challenge
  * 5.75 mile trail run at Deer Canyon.

Monday is the Bolder Boulder and I was thinking I wanted to head to Pikes Peak to run with the Incline Club on Sunday, but after today&#8217;s trail run I think I realized that may not be the smartest thing the day before the BB!
