Monday: fun 6.6 mile run at 8:14 pace. It was gorgeous mid-day then got colder, but my run felt pretty good.

Tuesday: [crossfit in the am](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/03/crossfit-wod-including-running/), which included running! Then a super 10.1 mile ladder workout with the RRBs in the evening. My pace kept speeding up, I think the morning sprints confused my legs. I may have to sprint in the mornings more often! ðŸ˜‰

Wednesday: great 5 mile run at an 8:27 pace in the morning &#8211; a little cooler than I expected but it felt great!

Thursday: [crossfit in the am](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/03/crossfit-wod-jenny/). Pretty short workout. Then it was gorgeous out and I was craving a run but there just wasn&#8217;t time. Instead, I bought a book on the paleo diet for athletes &#8211; does that count for something?? (and then I went and ate sopapillas, so probably not!) 

Friday: I decided to wait until the afternoon to run to enjoy the sun, but it ended up getting to 80*, which was too warm to be enjoyable. I knew I had a lot of miles coming up on the weekend, so I just did 4 at an 8:31 pace.

Saturday: Great track workout with the RRBs. I thought the goal paces my group set out were a bit fast, but I ended up feeling great and dropping the group. My last 800s were at a 5:58 and a 5:52 pace! 10.65 miles total, with 5.25 at a 6:30 pace or faster. Intervals ranged from 800m &#8211; 2K. Later in the afternoon I hit up the gym for a few hours. Managed to squeak out 4 kipping pullups in a row!

Sunday: 20 miler with KJ at an 8:32 pace (we did 8:35mm for the first 10, 8:29mm on the second).

Total mileage for the week: 57.85 (even without a mid-week long run or any two-a-days!). I felt really strong all week, definitely excited for my half marathon in a few weeks! 

The other day Meredith posted about [monthly mileage](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/2012/03/march-run-streak.html). Right now I&#8217;m sitting at 175 with 6 days to go in the month. Looks like this will be my first month ever cresting 200 miles!

BTW &#8211; can you guess when I started training with the [Running Republic of Boulder](http://www.runningrepublic.com)?
