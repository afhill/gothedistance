Had a pretty good mix of workouts this week. My nutrition has also been a bit better, to be sure I can keep it up. I actually took an airborne this morning. On the weekend I enjoyed a few beers, but it didn&#8217;t seem to throw me off at all. 

I got some really great runs in, and my derby practices went well. I&#8217;m feeling good! (please oh please don&#8217;t let me have just jinxed myself!)

Monday: Mad abs, power 30 class. Power 30 was like bootcamp/crossfit: 2x(25 each of: crossed lunges, weighted squats, weighted rows, woodchoppers, pushups, + 150 mountain climbers). 

Tuesday: run speed workout, 2 hr MHC team practice

Wednesday: upper body at the gym, 2hr scrimmage, 1hr MHC team practice (hurt my quad a little)

Thursday: Tough hill run (on paved road, starting at 7400ft). 

Friday: skipped a planned long run, instead did arms at the gym 

Saturday: 10K trail race, legs at the gym

Sunday: jogged/ran up at 14K, led pick-up derby for ~2hrs
