I woke up early today, and decided to take a little drive&#8230;

After my few runs this week, I&#8217;d been thinking that I wanted to get some altitude in, but with the [Barr Trail Mountain Race]('http://runpikespeak.com/) on today, Pikes Peak didn&#8217;t seem a great idea.

I&#8217;d never been to Mt. Evans before, but I knew there was a race up there every year (the [Mt. Evans Ascent](http://www.racingunderground.com/mtevans/) &#8211; the highest road race in America, it starts at 10K feet and climbs to 14K). Some friends hiked [Mt. Bierstadt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Bierstadt) yesterday, but I really just wanted to spend time at the top, not expend a lot of energy getting up there! So I loaded up the car and set off to Mt. Evans shortly before 7am. 

I REALLY enjoyed the drive; whereas the Pikes Peak road has scared me even as a passenger, this was quiet and didn&#8217;t make me as anxious. En route, I saw a bit of wildlife, but there was more to come ðŸ™‚ At the Summit were quite a few photographers (in fact, I was the only person there without a serious camera), and I soon found out why. The mountain goats were everywhere, and would get quite close!

I tried to start my Garmin at the top and it didn&#8217;t cooperate, so I tried to use my iPhone LogYourRun app. However, I wasn&#8217;t really sure how it would do since there was no cell service that high. It was supposedly a quarter-mile jaunt from the parking lot to the actual summit. The distance itself really wasn&#8217;t super important, I just wanted to get used to being up that high. The sun was shining but there was a brutal wind! I spent some time just taking in the views, feeling so incredibly at peace.

I also ran down the road a bit, just enjoying the beauty of the day. It wasn&#8217;t intended to be a hard workout as I raced yesterday and have another tomorrow, it was really more about getting used to the altitude and just enjoying the day. 

On my way back down I stopped at Summit Lake, which was beautiful. For a moment I considered running up the trail, but decided to save it for another day. I headed into Idaho Springs and decided to grab lunch. I wandered a bit, then decided to m stop at the original [BeauJo&#8217;s](http://www.beaujos.com/) for a &#8220;Colorado-style pizza&#8221;. Apparently I got there early enough to avoid the long lines they often encounter! I made reasonable choices, for a pizza place: I got their tofu pizza on honey whole wheat crust and ricotta cheese. Yum! 

I had a nice drive home listening to the Endurance Planet podcast, and was home before 2pm. What a great morning. It&#8217;s days like these that I know why I chose to live in Colorado, and I&#8217;m so thankful for my health and ability to enjoy it!
