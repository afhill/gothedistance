My target marathon pace for this year is 3:23:00, a New York Qualifying time. Most of my long runs are with &#8216;the gang&#8217;, and I don&#8217;t hold myself to a particular pace. Looking at my last few weeks, however, the pace been:

March 1: 8:37 (16mi)  
Feb 23: 8:47 (11mi)  
Feb 9: 9:02 (9mi)

Hm, I just noticed that the pace is picking up, nice!

Today I&#8217;m doing my long run on my own, so I can hold myself to a certain pace. The Pfitzinger plan states that your long run should be between 10%-20% slower than your target race pace. 

A 3:23 marathon is a 7:44 pace.  
10% slower = 8:30 pace  
20% slower = 9:16 pace

So based on the above, I&#8217;m right on track! This will help me as I set out today &#8212; I still haven&#8217;t decided if I want to run outside in the snow (it&#8217;s official, we got over 20 inches), or walk to the gym and run inside. If I thought I could run a decent pace, outside may not be too bad, but 18miles is pretty far if the roads are going to be rough.
