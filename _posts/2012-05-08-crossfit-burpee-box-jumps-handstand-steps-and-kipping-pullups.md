Well, we tried. Loren and I tried to go to a crossfit alternative (Qi fit, at a local club called Qi). And it turns out we reeeaaalllllly like crossfit (maybe we also just really like crossfit lodo?). So today we returned to crossfit. I still have a couple classes to take on my pass and Loren bought another punch card. Yes &#8211; the groupon worked and earned them a new customer!!

Oh yeah, the workout.

>     We started on the snatch instruction, which just further cemented the appreciation Loren and I have for Crossfit Lodo. It doesn&#8217;t matter that much of the class has been doing this for months or years, we started with the basics and a PVC pipe to work on technique. Crossfit gets a bad rap for sacrificing form for speed, but there is a lot of good instruction and practice here.

>     For the actual workout, gals did a 20in box. I actually found the burpee box jumps not as bad as regular burpees &#8211; the more lateral jump was a nice change from the repetitive motion. For the handstand walks, I just used the wall and lifted my hands. It&#8217;s the most basic of the options but I was happy to focus on just getting the technique down. I finished first in the class with an 8:06. The instructor said that was a good time.

>     
>     The workout was run where you did 10 V-ups and 1 pullup, then 9 V-ups and 2 pullups, all the way to 1 V-up and 10 pullups. At first I had a 20lbs medicine ball and I couldn&#8217;t even do one V-up! So I swapped out to a 14 and got to work.

>     Although there were a good 10 people in the class, there were only 4 of us (I think) attempting the pullups &#8211; me and three guys. I was the short one who needed the box to even reach the bar! I was sorry I&#8217;d done those 12 pullups before we started! I think I managed 6 unbroken the first time, but after that I&#8217;d generally only get through 3 or 4 before having to reset. I was pretty beat by the end but I worked my way through. I was the last one done (no big surprise) but I felt a great sense of satisfaction! At the end, the instructor complemented me on my form. I commented that I&#8217;d lose momentum after 3 or 4 but he said I looked notably better than the last time he&#8217;d seen me. More importantly, I did like 57 total today! And then had trouble gripping the steering wheel on the way home&#8230;
