Ok, I&#8217;m getting sick of these VO2 Max workouts. It&#8217;s pretty bad when I&#8217;m in the middle of one, and already dreading the next one. They&#8217;re not &#8216;too hard&#8217;, it&#8217;s just .. I don&#8217;t know, not fun I guess.

_VO2 max 8 mi w/ 5 x 600 m @ 5K race pace (7:04); jog 90 sec between_

200m: :52/ :53  
600m: 2:38

I did roughly the same warm-up as usual &#8211; ran to Arcadia. I ran at 1pm, and campus was packed! I think I ran a bit faster than I needed to, so once I hit Clintonville I slowed down a bit. Also, I actually carried water with me. I stopped and walked for a couple minutes, so my warm-up time isn&#8217;t accurate.

I also did my splits at a bit of a different place to try to get rid of that weird short middle 200, it&#8217;s better but still a bit off. Interesting to compare to even a few weeks ago &#8211; despite the heat today, my times were better overall, and I didn&#8217;t fade as I have in the past. Hurrah for me!

I did take it easy on the way home as well. Part of me felt like the important part of the workout went well, so it was ok to be slow and stop for water, etc on the way home (my water bottle got hot so I threw it away).
