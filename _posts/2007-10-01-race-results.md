I would have been 4th girl overall, first in the elusive 30-34 age group&#8230;

ah well. it wasn&#8217;t my target race. I&#8217;ll just have to prove myself next weekend ðŸ™‚

Also &#8212; based on the fact the 2nd and 3rd place women finished at the exact same time, at a 7:09 pace, I think I must have been mistaken, and never been in 3rd place. Not a big deal, just something I noticed.. ðŸ™‚
