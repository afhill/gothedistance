Even after a rough start this morning, I didn&#8217;t want not to run today. So around 12:30pm I started out for my target 20 miler. I set my watch, but I wasn&#8217;t sure I&#8217;d be able to stick with my target pace (8:53). 

I felt all right at first, but was running into the wind and not able to keep the pace. Then just past mile three the path becomes paved and goes under an underpass, and the front of my knee hurt! So I stopped for awhile, and then resigned myself to walking back to the apartment. But any runner knows the walk back is worse than most pain, so after a bit, I started jogging again. Funny, the break and the fact I was no longer against the wind (and, perhaps not going on a decline?) and I felt pretty strong! So strong that I skipped the first turn-off to the apartment. And the second. I decided to keep going towards the rec center, so I could see how far it really was to jog to.

Once I got there and had to turn around, the run started to feel a bit harder, but my pace doesn&#8217;t really reflect it. All in all, I put in 7 miles this afternoon. Coupled with 1.25 this morning, and I at least got some mileage in. As well, while I was walking I arranged via text message to run tomorrow with a friend, so I know I&#8217;ll at least get some mileage this weekend, even if it&#8217;s over a series of runs.

Target: 8:53 pace

M1: 8:55  
M2: 8:57  
M3: 8:56 &#8211; stopped my watch and walked for a bit, then recommenced  
M4: 8:51  
M5: 8:50  
M6: 8:47  
M7: 8:22  
&#8212;-  
7 miles in 1:01:40 (8:48 pace).

This morning when I wasn&#8217;t feeling great, I wasn&#8217;t sure if my heart rate was elevated, so after my run I decided to look back at some other runs. I don&#8217;t do heart rate training, but I do like the data collection just to refer back to ðŸ™‚ 

Today &#8211; 7 miles &#8211; average 8:48 pace &#8211; avgHR 158, maxHR 173  
11/14 &#8211; 13.3 miles &#8211; average 8:36 pace &#8211; avgHR 165, maxHR 176  
10/30 &#8211; 18 miles &#8211; average 8:54 pace &#8211; avgHR155, maxHR 172

It doesn&#8217;t seem too crazy or out of the ordinary, although it would be interesting to know what the drift would be like had I run longer. 

Ya know, when I look at these elevation charts, it really shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that I finish strong.. (and looking at the max heart rate, you can see where I stopped to walk, and then stopped at the rec center and then the parking lot right next to it!)
