Today I went into the office for the first time in a week, which also meant a stop in at PVC. I missed it! It&#8217;s amazing to me how I can sweat so much during an abs class, but I do! 

#### Food

  * 2 cinnamon raisin whole-grain English muffins with peanut butter and hemp seed
  * 2 apples
  * [garden vegetable soup with pesto, strawberry poppyseed salad (no chicken)](http://www.panerabread.com/menu/cafe/)
  * tea
  * lentils and peas with whole-wheat naan
  * caraway crackers
  * probar superfood slam
  * nectarine
  * pb chickpea bar

#### Exercise

  * 27 atomic pushups on the TRX
  * 30 min Mad Abs class
  * 2hrs MHC practice
  * chin ups

Today I ate well, and I think going to the gym was really good for me as well. I&#8217;ve fallen out of what was a really good pattern. Practice actually felt great too, despite the fact I just bouted yesterday. I&#8217;m going to be playing against Charm City when they come to town July 9th, which I&#8217;m looking forward to. The Charm City bout last July was my first bout jamming with MHC, so it&#8217;ll be nice from sentimental reasons!
