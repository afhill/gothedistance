Turns out I thrive with this here blog keeping me accountable. This was a BAD weekend, food-wise. I went home to visit family, which meant a bit of a celebration and a bit of &#8220;leaving food choices up to others&#8221;. I think I broke all the cardinal Eat Clean rules: white flour in the pizza and pasta, cheese sprinkled on pasta (I actually ordered a cheeseless pizza though!), beer, wine, ice cream, even a [chocolate bar](http://www.nestle.ca/en/products/brands/big_turk/index)! 

I know, I know. I&#8217;m not ON the TBT. But I still want to eat clean, so actually being on the program gives me a good excuse. Saturday night was a bit of a tough one: I went to my brother and sister-in-law&#8217;s, but they didn&#8217;t know I was a vegetarian (ok, pescaterian, but trying to remove fish from my diet). Turns out they had steak on the menu üôÅ My parents told them I didn&#8217;t eat meat, so they asked if I&#8217;d eat fish.. I hedged and said yes because I didn&#8217;t want them feeling bad. Then my brother asked if I&#8217;d eat sour cream, I said no, and then he asked about putting cheese on something he had planned. I felt really bad being the cause of their changing their menu, so I said it was fine. Then the next night, they got spinach and feta ravioli, specifically for me :-/

I felt like CRAP all weekend, and I don&#8217;t know if diet was related at all. But now I&#8217;m back home, and I&#8217;m going to start keeping track of this, and doing what I know my body needs, rather than &#8216;treating myself&#8217; at every sign of temptation. Summer will be tough, with all the delicious cold beverages that beckon.
