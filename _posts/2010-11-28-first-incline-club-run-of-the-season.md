Today I headed to Colorado Springs to meet up with the [Incline Club](http://inclineclub.com/). I&#8217;d asked Andrea J (Loren Order from DRD) if she wanted to come with me, and was pleasantly surprised she agreed! We met at a McDonalds in south Denver and drove together. 

it was the first meeting of the year so there was a great turnout! But we&#8217;d just nicely got there when I saw the two Mikes I know (there are really only three people I talk to, two are named Mike ðŸ™‚ ) We exchanged pleasantries, took a group photo and soon set off. 

After yesterday, I was a bit worried about my knee but it felt fine. We steadily climbed and I remembered why I&#8217;d never completed the Ute trail before: it had some crazy uphills! Within two miles we were above 7K feet. It was definitely warmer than anticipated and I quickly shed my jacket. 

I had a blast with Andrea, we chatted the whole time! And as I&#8217;d been telling her before we set out, trail runners are really a different breed. It&#8217;s so much about the experience rather than the competition. People were friendly and chatty, and a few times we&#8217;d just stop and survey our surroundings and marvel at them. It really is amazing to live in Colorado.

Like most runs on the mountain, the way back was much quicker and more pleasant than the way up, and our return trip flew by! We made it back to the park before 10am, smiling and happy to have a good run behind us. We stretched (both of us are trying to get into the habit) then drove back to town. What a great way to start a Sunday, and it was really nice to have new company to share it with.

Now &#8211; the ever-present elevation chart (this one will make yesterday look like a joke!)

All in all, we ran 7.4 miles in 1:47:30. So funny to think that I ran 7 miles yesterday in an hour But yesterday hurt and this was a blast!
