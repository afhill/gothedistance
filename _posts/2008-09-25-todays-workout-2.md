Today I met with Meredith for another of her scheduled workouts. 

20 minutes warm-up, 15x(1:00 @ 5K pace, 1:00 recovery), 15 minutes cooldown.

We met in the middle of the afternoon, when it was nice and steamy. After a few repeats, we switched to walking part of the recovery.  
Overall, it was a decent workout. Certainly not easy, but that&#8217;s what makes it a workout, right?

The biggest challenge with &#8220;5K pace&#8221; is determining what that is! My PR is a 7:04 pace, so I had my garmin set for a 6:30-7:15 range. However, Meredith didn&#8217;t realize it was beeping at the upper limit as well, so sometimes she&#8217;d push HARDER after it beeped that we were going too fast. 

So how did our repeats go? Overall, I&#8217;m pretty content:  
1: 7:01 &#8211; avgHR 167 &#8211; maxHR 175  
2: 7:02 &#8211; avgHR 171 &#8211; maxHR 179  
3: 7:18 &#8211; avgHR 172 &#8211; maxHR 179  
4: 7:06 &#8211; avgHR 174 &#8211; maxHR 180  
5: 6:37 &#8211; avgHR 176 &#8211; maxHR 180  
6: 6:45 &#8211; avgHR 171 &#8211; maxHR 180  
7: 6:41 &#8211; avgHR 171 &#8211; maxHR 179  
8: 6:42 &#8211; avgHR 171 &#8211; maxHR 179  
9: 6:50 &#8211; avgHR 172 &#8211; maxHR 181  
10:6:33 &#8211; avgHR 173 &#8211; maxHR 181  
11:7:02 &#8211; avgHR 172 &#8211; maxHR 180  
12:6:52 &#8211; avgHR 172 &#8211; maxHR 181  
13:7:05 &#8211; avgHR 168 &#8211; maxHR 178  
14:6:52 &#8211; avgHR 172 &#8211; maxHR 181 

Despite the heat, we definitely kept the repeats going strong. It was hard to try to keep a conversation going with all the intervals, but it was a good workout and I&#8217;m happy to sneak in any running I can with folks before I leave. 

Hard to believe the marathon is in just over three weeks!
