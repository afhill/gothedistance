I have been burnt out from running since RnRAZ, yet I&#8217;ve also been missing my friends from Ohio. I decided to go back to Ohio this upcoming weekend to do the <a href="http://premierraces.com/LastChance/lastchance.html" rel="nofollow">Last Chance for Boston</a> race in Dublin (with requisite carb-loading with my peeps the night before). I had been planning to run the half marathon with <a href="http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Meredith</a>, as she had been planning to run 1:39. The other day she was tossing around the idea of a faster run, so I bit the bullet and just upgraded to my preferred race distance.

Yes, the &#8220;burnt out from running&#8221; girl is doing a marathon on Sunday.
