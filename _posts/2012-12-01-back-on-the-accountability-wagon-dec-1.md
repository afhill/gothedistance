I remarked to Loren the other day that I&#8217;ve been slacking on everything but running. Which is really not smart for me; I know I am a much better athlete with more baskets. (I&#8217;m still determining how many eggs I have). So, I started diversifying yesterday and hit up yoga in the evening. It&#8217;s really pretty remarkable how it makes me feel; even before the class had started, I felt my &#8220;monkey mind&#8221; calm. 

Today was a standard Saturday workout and then I decided to hit up the gym. And while I was there (using fleetly to find exercises and guide me), I thought of how much more motivated I was when I was tracking and blogging- plus, I have a record to look back on. So, here goes!

Only 51 days to RnRAZ, hope this&#8217;ll all come together!!

Sports Nutrition: I took some pre-workout accelerator, which helped but did make me a bit jittery. I felt really dizzy after the run, possibly bc I&#8217;ve felt sick the past few days and haven&#8217;t been the best eater. I did take vega recovery protein right after and then felt better. Stuck to tea instead of coffee or chai after the run so I wasn&#8217;t overdoing the stimulants. 

Not really sports nutrition, but I tried to chug a beer to prep for the beer mile. new planet raspberry ale in a bottle (didn&#8217;t realize it was raspberry til the first sip): 1:14. I have some work to do! 

Exercise:  
8.78 run. Didn&#8217;t feel great, pulled myself back at parts. Ugh!! Still need to get my head in the game. My legs are feeling a bit tired but I know I&#8217;ve been increasing my mileage/intensity over the past few weeks and I&#8217;m confident it&#8217;ll work itself out.  
Then we did the General Strength and Myrtl work with Jay.  
After coffee I went to the gym. Did (most of) two Fleetly routines. One &#8220;explosive power&#8221;- I couldn&#8217;t quite get the reps for the 85lb Bench press or the 60lb military press, but it&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve hit up that weight. Then I did the p90x AB ripper&#8230; Except I was dead by the time I got to v-ups and my legs refused to lift!  
Finished it off with 100 5lb bicep curls. Mmmmm muscle fatigue!  
I was good and tired by the end. Nothing gets me quite like a good lifting session!  
Later at home did random pull-ups and arm hangs with the derby girls.
