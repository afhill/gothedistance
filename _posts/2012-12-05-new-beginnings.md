I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve really mentioned it yet, but I&#8217;m working with a new coach, and VERY excited about it!  
Back in August I was burnt out and considering leaving my training group. I&#8217;d gotten my mileage up to it highest level but wasn&#8217;t feeling well prepared for my fall races. Also, I was about to start classes on Tuesday nights (a key workout night for the group) for the next year and a half. When I twinged my hamstring one night, I took that as a sign. I gave myself an early off-season from running and decided something in my training had to change. 

Fortunately, I didn&#8217;t have to do the hard work. My run club also decided time was ripe for change and reformed as a new club with a new coach. Our training times went from Tues night to Tues morning. And I almost feel like I can&#8217;t just say we rebranded, because although many of my training partners and friends stayed the same, there is a really different vibe.

Each workout starts with a dynamic warmup (the &#8220;[lunge matrix](http://www.coachjayjohnson.com/2010/04/lunge-matrix-as-warm-up/)&#8220;) and ends with a big &#8220;[general strength and mobility](http://www.coachjayjohnson.com/2011/11/eight-week-general-strength-progression/)&#8221; session. As in, we bring yoga mats and do 20 minutes of planks, squats and other &#8220;stuff&#8221; to make us more than just runners. Our new coach is [Jay Johnso](http://www.coachjayjohnson.com/)n, and he is huge on ancillary work and loves to share different routines with us. He has us doing &#8220;Myrtl&#8221; (for improving your hip girdle) and a Phil Wharton foot and ankle routine at home as well. 



I got extra excited last week when he told us he wants us to get medicine balls and kettlebells, and after Tuesday workouts we&#8217;ll have an extra (optional) 30 minute strength session. So much for my worrying about going to the gym for strength! 

Then of course there is the actual coaching aspect. Jay has been very amenable to different people&#8217;s goals (Laura loves to race 5Ks on practically a weekly basis, Beth is building up a base prior to starting Ironman training) but diligent in trying to impress good practices re: taper and recovery and training intensity on us. He wants us to be more disciplined in our workouts, not going all out and learning how to negative split. He observes the workouts, taking photos so we can look at our form. I really feel like he is instilling in us some great habits that will contribute to longevity and good races. 

I met with Jay yesterday to talk about my 2013 goals, of which he was supportive. I also feel like (even though he didn&#8217;t say it), there is somewhat less pressure to kill every race. Last year I felt like I had to try to PR at everything I did, which took the fun away. This year I feel differently. It&#8217;s more like I can have actual A races, and still do others. That&#8217;s how I was when I just ran back in Columbus and I think it&#8217;ll be REALLY good for me. 

Oh! And he encourages us to get up to altitude for long runs, which has made Sunday runs much more interesting! He knows I love the Pikes Peak run so he&#8217;s suggested a special Sunday workout for me to prepare.

I&#8217;ve also started running with members of the group more consistently on our easy days. Such a far cry from having to do all my runs by myself here for so long! Now I really never run alone, I meet with a handful of folks to run most Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings. Tues and Sat are our official workouts. I meet with some combination of folks Sunday, and Thursday is my off day. Although I&#8217;ve been a bit down about how my races have been, I am definitely feeling great about actually running again! The social aspect has been huge and I really value the friendships I&#8217;m forming. I love to run, and I love the great people I&#8217;m getting to know through it!
