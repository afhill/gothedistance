F: recovery + speed 5mi w/ 6x100m strides

So, a few things I&#8217;ll definitely deviate on  
a) the race is on Monday ðŸ™‚  
b) at the end of the &#8220;1 week to go&#8221;, I&#8217;m running the Cap City Half on Sat.  
c) No rest for me!

( It&#8217;s too bad the [Alum Creek 10K](http://ultrafit-usa.com/alumcreek5k10k08_template.html) is next Sunday instead of next Sat. )

Other than that, I think I&#8217;ll try to hit the specific target workouts as closely as I can. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s only three weeks away! I did see that there is no Freedom Run this year due to the Women&#8217;s Olympic Trials. I&#8217;m sorry for the break from tradition, but it&#8217;ll be pretty incredible to see some amazing athletes!
