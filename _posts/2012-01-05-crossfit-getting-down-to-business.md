Tonight was the last of our 4 &#8220;basics&#8221; classes for Crossfit. We&#8217;ve now learned many of the basic maneuvers and terminology. Now I have 16 more classes in my deal to give it a try. 

After class, Loren and I stayed and talked a couple of the instructors. We&#8217;re both pretty busy with our other athletic pursuits. Loren asked the one guy how this would fit in with her training, and he kinda said &#8220;this is it&#8221;. He said that he also does triathlon, but his training is primarily crossfit, with one swim, one bike and one run per week. That crossfit keeps him in good enough shape to do fine come race day. I guess they do have a CFE (crossfit endurance) coach who works with athletes to develop a program to help them reach their specific goals, and the owner, Georgia, said that he&#8217;d be able to cut our miles in half, while helping us get faster. 

After we walked out, Loren and I talked.. the thing is, I LIKE/LOVE running.. it&#8217;s not just a means to an end (a race). What the coach said today sorta made me think of good ole Tim Ferriss &#8211; find the most economical means to achieve a specific goal (isn&#8217;t he an advocate of the paleo diet, by the way? Hmm..). 

I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;d love the workouts. Obviously the tracking and monitoring is right up my alley. I&#8217;m just not sure if it&#8217;s something that can just be done on the side or occasionally. I realized yesterday that the 8hrs/week I had derby practice are completely booked now with running, and I don&#8217;t know about trying yet again to balance a few intensive sports.

I guess we&#8217;ll see how the next few weeks go![<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/skitched-20120105-213543.png" alt="" title="crossfit skills" width="353" height="578" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3206" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/skitched-20120105-213543.png)
