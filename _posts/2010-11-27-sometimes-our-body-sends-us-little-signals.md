I think I&#8217;m getting sick!

There could have been little signs: my race Thursday was harder than it should have been, and yesterday I took a luxurious 3 hour afternoon nap. It felt great, but it&#8217;s unusual for me to need that sleep. I&#8217;ve been drinking more OJ, and yesterday I even bought Ginger Ale at the store. Also, my back and neck have been sore: not totally unusual, but I&#8217;ve been able to crack my neck myself, which isn&#8217;t common. 

Today I woke up for my 20 miler, and I just feel off. I was actually over-dressed so I turned around within .75mi to drop off my jacket at the apartment, fully intending to go out again. But I got upstairs and I was just feeling beat.

Then it occurred to me that two of the folks I was out with on Wednesday night are sick. If I were more diligent at tracking my resting heart rate, I bet it&#8217;d be elevated now. There&#8217;s no good reason for my fitness to be out the window unless my energy were being diverted elsewhere: fighting off whatever it is. 

Ugh. But at least I can try to help my body along and not get discouraged that it&#8217;s not performing as I want it to.
