Came home from my business trip today, and I&#8217;m happy to be back! It&#8217;s so much easier to eat at home when I&#8217;m in charge of my own food and schedule. Although I&#8217;ve basically given up coffee at home, for whatever reason I drink it a lot when I&#8217;m traveling. On the plane home I felt really uncomfortable and unable to concentrate. Yuck. 

I did decide to expend my energy with a really hard workout, so I FINALLY made it over to Crossfit Lohi. Oooh, and SUPER excited, I got a huge sample pack of [Vega Sport](http://vegasport.com/) to try out and review! The presentation was awesome:
