Oof!

I woke up this morning definitely feeling the effects of my activity yesterday. I&#8217;m pretty well sore everywhere above my legs. Glutes (though they havent stopped being sore since I started doing kettlebell), abs, back, chest, arms, hands and shoulders. Somewhat surprisingly (though thankfully), my hamstrings feel fine. 

Food  
&#8211; pb chickpea bars  
&#8211; egg whites, tomato, greens on Ezekiel bread  
&#8211; sugar snap peas  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; spinach salad with tofu  
&#8211; quinoa  
&#8211; pita chips with guac  
&#8211; vega sports optimizer  
&#8211; trail mix: sunflower seeds, raisins, walnuts  
&#8211; apple  
&#8211; sweet potato, black beans in a whole wheat tortilla  
&#8211; coconut water

Exercise  
&#8211; 6 mile tempo run in 45:07 (8:09, 8:06, 6:54, 7:02, 6:46, 8:11)  
&#8211; kettlebell class. Different instructor, not as good of a workout. But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m too disappointed about that today ðŸ˜‰
