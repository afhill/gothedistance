Weight: 113. 

Although i havent had much sleep the last two nights, i got up to work out. 1000 crunches, shoulder work, arms. I felt better after that, at least a bit.

Protein requirements are .8-1.8g/kg of body weight. My weight is 51kilos so 41-77g is good.

Am supplements: Lifiber with apple juice, iron, adrenal supplement, glucosamine, one-a-day, b-force, salmon oil, hemp seed oil.  
Am: kefir smoothie (12g protein but high sugar),  
Breakfast: oatmeal and pb (10g protein)  
lunch: 1/2 veggie protein cutlet (10g protein), brown rice (2g), steamed veggies  
Pm: Greek yogurt with hemp seeds (18g)  
Dinner: tuna (15g) and spinach with olive oil  
Pm supplements: Lifiber with oj, salmon oil, b-force

Total: 67g protein! the lunch was abnormally high, I&#8217;ll admit I struggled to get that cutlet down. But it&#8217;s really interesting to see how much protein is packed away in things like the hemp seed. It would be super easy to throw a handful into my oatmeal. 

Tonight I scanned through the Eat-Clean cookbook. I swear, I could make some of this stuff! ðŸ™‚

I&#8217;m bummed about my bursitis diagnosis, but I&#8217;m going to try to throw my energy into strength training.
