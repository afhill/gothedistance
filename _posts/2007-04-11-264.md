I received my 4th and final email update about the Paris marathon today. Ah, it seems like a lifetime ago that I applied to run that race. So strange that it is this weekend, and at one point I thought I would be there, visiting with N and getting ready to run! As it turns out, work is crazy busy right now and I don&#8217;t know I would have been able to get away (I pulled a nice 16 hr workday on Monday). It is so strange how just moving forward in life one step at a time can take us places we would have never expected&#8230;
