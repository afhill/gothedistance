Marathon(+) #10 all done!

I finished in 3:42:42, which I&#8217;m happy with. I&#8217;d told myself I&#8217;d like to run 3:40, but then I performed a classic mistake and went out waay too fast. I had a projected 3:30:54 finish there for a bit, which was definitely much more aggressive than I needed to be, even with the hills looming. 

Overall, I felt ok. Wasn&#8217;t hurting particularly, just ran out of steam. Once I got through the hills I couldn&#8217;t get the speed back up again. I am definitely going to benefit from more speed work this summer.

Helen pulled off a PR at 3:34. I&#8217;m so incredibly happy for her! We&#8217;re definitely doing 3:23 this fall (Guaranteed entry for NYC 2007).
