Next weekend I&#8217;m headed up to Washington state for a roller derby tournament, and I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m nervous. Not about the skating (though of course I am), but about the eating! Have you seen how much I&#8217;m eating every day? And how frequently? Although I managed to do all right when I was out of town for a day earlier this week, I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;ll manage a long weekend packed with activity. 

So with that in mind, I tried a few more bar recipes tonight. I&#8217;d rather bring along bars I made than expensive sugar-laden ones. 

The first was the [no-bake chickpea granola bar](http://www.nomeatathlete.com/homemade-granola-bars/) recipe that I found a few weeks back on No Meat Athlete. Of course, I modified it a bit:  
1 can of chickpeas, rinsed and drained  
2 tsp cinnamon  
2 tsp sucanat or natural sugar  
1 1/2 cup oatmeal  
1 cup whole grain cereal (like brown rice krispies)  
1 cup dried fruit  
1/2 cup natural peanut butter  
1/4 cup honey  
3 tbs canola oil  
1 tbs ground flax seed

I swapped molasses for the sucanat, used Flax Plus cereal for the cereal, added a few tablespoons of hemp protein powder, used agave for the honey, freeze-dried strawberries for the dried fruit, and unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil. I haven&#8217;t tried them yet, but they smell fantastic (and don&#8217;t look like poop!)

The second was [Cranberry vanilla no-bake breakfast bars](http://www.eatcleandiet.com/the_kitchen_table/recipe/recipe.aspx?id=1132). Again, some changes:  
* 4 1/2 cups OATMEAL  
* 1 cup GROUND FLAX SEEDS  
* 3/4 cup PROTEIN POWDER (non flavored or vanilla)  
* 6oz DRIED CRANBERRIES  
* 1 1/2 cup GREEK YOGURT (plain)  
* 1 Tbl STEVIA  
* 1 Tbl VANILLA EXTRACT  
I used my freeze dried strawberries in place of the cranberries, [yogurt cheese](http://www.eatcleandiet.com/food_and_recipes/clean_recipe/yogurt_cheese.aspx) instead of greek yogurt, and unsweetened applesauce in place of the stevia. I also threw in some wheat germ for good measure. I don&#8217;t have as high hopes for this one, the consistency seemed off and it does sorta look like poop. But, I&#8217;ll hold out for the taste test.

It was actually really nice to have the evening at home to make these. I also tried my hand at homemade hummus, which would be easier with a real food processor instead of a hand mixer. Still, it tasted all right. 

**EDIT:** As suspected, the pb chickpea bars were delicious! Nice and substantive, and the chickpeas added a lot texture-wise. The yogurt bars were not so good. Pretty dry and bland.
