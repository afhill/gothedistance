I obviously had a good workout yesterday, I felt it all day! I took my 30(ish) day pics, have to say my back surprises me, I guess bc I don&#8217;t see it daily. I used to see a chiropractor regularly and have back and shoulder pain and I feel lifting has really helped. 

As of today, I&#8217;m a member of Pura Vida club. They have a ton of different classes, including yoga and pilates. For joining, we had a choice of a free personal training or pilates session. I went for the training, and let them know I&#8217;m already pretty active. Hope it&#8217;ll be good!
