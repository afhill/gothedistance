So my goal for Houston is 3:19:59. That&#8217;ll be nearly 10 minutes faster than my current PR, but I&#8217;ve been running 3:29 since 2006 and I know I&#8217;ve improved leaps and bounds since then. 

Greg McMillan has created a [pace calculator](http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/index.php/site/calculator) that lets you estimate your equivalent performance at different distances. Honestly the thing has never really worked for me, because I over-performed in the marathon (my shorter distance paces predicted a slower marathon than I actually ran). But with the strength and speedwork I&#8217;ve been doing, those shorter distances are getting faster, and the &#8220;equivalent performances&#8221; are creeping up. 

Mile (5:58 in July) = 3:21:30  
10K (41:23 in November) = 3:14:13  
13.1 (1:33:44 in October) = 3:17:41

Also if I take my extrapolated 5K from last week &#8211;  
adjusted 5K (20:02) = 3:15:18

Now obviously there&#8217;s this tricky thing known as the Wall that comes into play when you get to the marathon distance. But this summer I [doubled Pikes Peak](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/08/pikes-peak-marathon-2011-race-report-d-d-d-d-doubler/) and did all right, and I&#8217;ve really never been a high mileage trainer. I&#8217;ve been doing more intense workouts, and I feel like running a flat course at a lower altitude will make a huge difference in my being able to sustain my pace. I know I really need to nail at least a couple more long runs, but I have confidence in my overall fitness. I can DO this!
