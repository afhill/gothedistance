Recently I read two books that allowed me to mix business with pleasure. I am an avid runner, and recently sought inspiration and enlightenment in &#8220;Marathon Woman: Running the Race to Revolutionize Women&#8217;s Sports&#8221; and &#8220;Out of Nowhere: The Inside Story of How Nike Marketed the Culture of Running.&#8221; 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/switzercover-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Marathon Woman Book Cover" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1027" />](http://www.afhill.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/switzercover.jpg)I met Kathrine Switzer, the first woman to enter and run the Boston marathon, at the Boston marathon expo this past April, and purchased this book from her. I finally got a chance to read it, and was really surprised at all Kathrine has done to legitimize women&#8217;s running. I knew she had made a statement by registering for the marathon as K.V. Switzer, but I did not realize that this was but a first step in a life dedicated to advancements in running. 

I expected the book to be related to her personal goals and drive, and I was pleasantly surprised to read about her involvement with the Avon Running program. My Mom was an &#8216;Avon Lady&#8217; as I was growing up, and I had no idea they had (indeed, pioneered!) a strong running program. In &#8220;Marathon Woman&#8221;, Kathrine describes how she submitted a comprehensive proposal for the women&#8217;s running circuit program that was eventually adopted. 

> Avon first introduced its International Running Circuit for women in 1978, yet athletes and women can still feel its effects today. A revolutionary program, the circuit provided women with the chance to experience competitive international running, to strengthen themselves and provide opportunity for generations to come. In its storied eight-year history, the series comprised more than 200 running events that stretched through 27 different countries and included over a million participants. Not only did the series have an incredible effect on the sports world and was instrumental in attracting more women to athletics, but Avon was also an integral force in getting the women&#8217;s marathon officially included in the Olympic Games beginning with the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics.

I was interested in how Kathrine approached marketing and branding. Too often I think we forget some of the basics: &#8220;when you are looking for sponsorship, don&#8217;t go to the companies that are already sponsoring events. Carve out something unique for someone different so they create their own identity.&#8221; Just as she was innovative in her Boston marathon application, Kathrine looked for innovative solutions to challenges. She looked at how to get sponsor logos in front of the cameras, including branding the finish line tape and placing the entrant number on a branded t-shirt for participants to wear. I was impressed with the innovation and dedication shown by this fellow runner. 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/outofnowhere-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Out of Nowhere Book Cover" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1028" />](http://www.afhill.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/outofnowhere.jpg)Another book dealing with marketing running and getting sponsor logos in front of people&#8217;s eyes is &#8220;Out of Nowhere&#8221;. This book follows the evolution from Nike&#8217;s grassroots beginnings to the mega-brand it is now. Both these books made me realize how naive I am regarding athlete and sporting event sponsorship! I had no idea all the politics that go on behind the scenes for the right athletes to be wearing the right gear. I will admit that I was a bit shocked at the ease with which it appeared athletes were willing to change their gear for the right dollar amount: athletes would train in one shoe, and appear wearing another for an event, for financial compensation. 

I will admit that I see Nike as the huge brand it is now, and it was refreshing for me to read about the young upstart company that didn&#8217;t have huge wads of cash to throw at athletes. As a company created by athletes for athletes, I enjoyed seeing how that common sense of shared passion really helped Nike achieve legitimacy and brand loyalty. 

Both the books were interesting as they were first-hand accounts, but much greater than biographies. I will admit that the fact that both authors went through tumultous personal relationships was a bit initimidating: were they both married to running instead? Indeed, running was more than a pastime, it was a way of life, a cause to believe in and be devoted to.

What allowed Kathrine and Geoff Hollister to contribute to such significant changes to the field of running? Their passion, obviously. &#8220;Out of Nowhere&#8221; almost tries to evoke a &#8220;David vs Goliath&#8221; feel, with Adidas being the big bad business throwing cash at wide-eyed talent. As runners who are able to really tap into what motivates runners, Kathrine and Geoff were able to develop programming that was relevant and effective. 

This is something I rail about often: a marketing message needs to be for the listener, not the speaker. Yes, obviously an organization is going to best stand behind a message that is in their best interest, but to really have good ROI, it needs to be something that the intended recipient is interested in. 

Nike is hands-down the best company for tapping into the running community and runners&#8217; motivations and needs. Their ability to identify and foster brand advocates has always been strong, and it&#8217;s even more evident in this age of social media and online community. I find it very uplifting and affirming that the reason for their success is simple: authenticity. 

It is not enough to recognize a void and attempt to fill it with business and theory: a strong sense of the motivations of the audience and an authentic voice will result in much greater return. The message of one brand advocate (from within the company?) to another will continue to spread long after the campaign dollars have been allocated. We runners have many miles to discuss advancements or events on those long runs. Lace up, let&#8217;s talk..
