Today was what I consider my last significant training run for Steamtown &#8211; I have some recovery runs on Friday and maybe Sat, but today was the big &#8220;7 miles with 2 at marathon pace&#8221; workout. The point is to do a &#8216;dress rehearsal&#8217; for the marathon, so I put on my new shorts, etc. Good thing I was making an effort to get everything together, because I realized I haven&#8217;t seen my watch since Saturday. I also learned  
&#8211; gu falls out of these stupid back pockets if you don&#8217;t really jam it in  
&#8211; the built-in underwear in shorts doesn&#8217;t ride up!

I headed to the track, and there was what must have been a Phys Ed class out there, so I felt a big conspicuous looping their track 28 times. It was 74 when I finished, so obviously I hope it wasn&#8217;t too closely mirroring Sunday! I felt overall pretty good, when I did the final 8 laps at what was supposed to be race pace (8 mm), I started out way too quickly, realized it about 200m in, and then tried to regulate my speed. By about 3 laps, I had the pace down perfectly (it was supposed to be 1:59/lap to make up for the fact it&#8217;s a bit less than a quarter mile)

My 20 laps for a warm-up I finished in 44:xx. Then b ecause I had to wear my crappy watch, I managed to mess up the time on the last lap, but I know I took off on the last 50m and finished fast.
