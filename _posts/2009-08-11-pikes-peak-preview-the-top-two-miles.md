Helen keeps saying she can&#8217;t wait to tell people we ran Pikes Peak. A small voice inside of me always correct &#8220;we DID Pikes Peak&#8221;. At a certain point, a run becomes a hike.

Last Sunday, the training run involved car-pooling to the summit, running down two miles, running back up, and then some members of the club helped clear the trail. 

Here&#8217;s the photos from that day. Consider this a &#8220;course preview&#8221;, if you will&#8230;
