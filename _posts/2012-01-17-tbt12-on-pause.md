After my race Sunday, my coach said no running this week.. I could swim or bike this weekend. I figured that would give me gym time! However, in an email today he further elaborated that we weren&#8217;t to hit the gym til the weekend either. So&#8230;. My TBT is on pause for a week. I&#8217;ll still eat reasonably clean but I will let myself eat that cheese I&#8217;ve been wanting since Sunday! I don&#8217;t really care about Sugar or white rice, but my body has been craving some good ole saturated fat!

So this is recovery! Something i&#8217;m not really used to. I generally hit a goal and I&#8217;m onto the next one. I trust my coach on this front in particular given Colleen&#8217;s longevity in the sport. He obviously has some ideas on how to prevent mental and physical burnout.
