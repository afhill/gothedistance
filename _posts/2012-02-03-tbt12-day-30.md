#### Food

&#8211; quinoa in coconut milk, cinnamon, blueberries, hemp seed  
&#8211; worst.juice.so.far &#8211; cauliflower, tomato, cilantro, spinach, lemon.  
&#8211; almond butter, hemp seed, apple sandwich on an Ezekiel English muffin  
&#8211; homemade kombucha  
&#8211; cashews  
&#8211; homemade chocolate chia tea latte with coconut milk and cocoa powder  
&#8211; Vega protein bar (this has sugar but I have a bunch of their products I need to sample within the next week)  
&#8211; Kabocha squash soup with coconut milk and cilantro, Ezekiel bread  
&#8211; Vega whole food optimizer with coconut milk

Today I came across this video. Although I think this guy is a bit over the top with his fat-phobia, this sort of stuff frustrates me. Why must consumers be mislead???



#### Exercise

Glorious 6.6 mile run through snowdrifts! This is how you know you&#8217;re a runner &#8211; you can barely see as snow flies in your face and your feet squish in your shoes, and you love every minute of it!
