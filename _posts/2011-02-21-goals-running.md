Despite the fact I got injured in my goal race, I think following the [Run Less Run Faster](http://www.runlessrunfasterbook.com/uof/runlessrunfasterbook/) plan worked really well. I was able to commit to the few days and higher intensity, and I think I&#8217;m seeing the results now, even after injury. My last few runs (races I wasn&#8217;t really training for) were well faster than an 8mm and I do think it&#8217;s because I did that training at a faster pace. I definitely want to continue working on speed rather than overall mileage.

I&#8217;d told myself I&#8217;d work on shorter distances this year, and I WILL stick to it. That being said, there are a few longer races I still want to do. I like the Barr Trail Mountain race in July, and I&#8217;m co-coordinating a team for the Rocky Mountain Relay, also in July. Then on my birthday is the Pikes Peak Marathon &#8211; there is no way I can miss it!

Through PT I&#8217;ve been working a lot more on correcting my muscle imbalances and stance, and also doing a lot more explosive movements. I will continue this as a complement to my running. I feel so much more powerful now than when I was just running mile after mile. I will also commit to stretching more (especially hamstrings) and using the foam roller. 

Although it&#8217;s subject to change, I think my running should be Monday morning, Thursday, Saturday morning. I&#8217;d love for it to always be in the mornings but I&#8217;m not confident I&#8217;ll be able to get up and going after Wednesday practices (they go til 10pm). 

I know that running isn&#8217;t really a great exercise for someone looking to build muscle, but I think if I focus more on explosive power and speed, it&#8217;ll help me overall.
