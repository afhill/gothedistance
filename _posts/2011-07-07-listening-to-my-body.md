As I&#8217;m still mostly eating clean, I&#8217;ve been able to notice some things about the ole bod. The other night shortly before bed I had some orange juice (tropicana, not freshly squeezed) and almost immediately felt like I was bloated. I know when bodybuilders are cutting, they eliminate excess carbs, and I can see why. I felt gross afterwards.  
Today I tried my second frozen pizza since starting the TBT. This was a tofurky one, the other was an Amy&#8217;s cheeseless. Turns out despite the fact these are &#8220;healthy&#8221;, they do NOT agree with me. I&#8217;ve never known myself to have any issues with gluten, but so far I&#8217;m 0 for 2 in the frozen pizza selection.

Today&#8217;s workout was another from the Muscle and Fitness Hers article. This was high reps, lower intensity. 15-20 reps of each, no rest between. Then a minute rest and repeat all two more times. The article also called for high intensity interval training, but i skipped that part.
