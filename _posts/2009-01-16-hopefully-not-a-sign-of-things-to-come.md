I stopped at the apartment leasing office just as I was about to head to the airport, and when I went out to the car, it wouldn&#8217;t start. I grabbed my phone to call a cab (with the fancy iPhone app to do just that), and my phone was acting up.

Ha ha ha, world.

Thankfully I WAS at my leasing office, so they arranged for my car to be moved to in front of my apartment, and called a cab for me. $85 later I was at the airport, to learn that my flight has been delayed. 

The thing is, those little hiccups could have put me in a bad mood, but they haven&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a bit amusing, and heck, it keeps me from getting too nervous about the run itself! So from that standpoint, it actually helps that I can see that I&#8217;m not letting these things break me down. I&#8217;m not letting myself make excuses. 

Interesting.. I just remembered the big news I got at the airport in Boston last April: my cat who&#8217;d been missing for three weeks had been found! Evidently it&#8217;s getting to be routine that before a run something happens that will require my attention on return home (recover a missing cat, fix a broke-down Elantra). Boston went well, so hopefully this will follow that same pattern!
