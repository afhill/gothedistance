Last night I went over to Brian and Bridget&#8217;s for drinks, I got a chance to chat with Brian a bit about running, but also just travelling, etc, it was really nice. At the end of the evening I offered to drive home a couple of their friends, who live quite close to me. Bridget was going to drop off their car this morning, and somehow we decided that we would run together after that. So at 8am this morning (a scant 7 hours after we make this wine-induced resolution), Bridget stopped by and we went for a nice 5 or 6 mile run. Both of us professed to being a bit tired from yesterday, but overall it felt pretty good. 

I was going to go to the gym today, but I think I may treat myself to a day off. Then on Monday (vacation! hurrah!) I can take the time for a good workout.
