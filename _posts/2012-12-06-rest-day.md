Today is my rest day, which was great. Even though I am starting to have a few of my silly doubts creep in, I was willing to take this day as a bit of a mental break. Instead, I went to hot yoga at lunch. I really enjoy it, but it does leave me with a good headache after &#8211; one of the only reasons I don&#8217;t do it more frequently :-/

Later I went over to Fuelary to use the boots. I&#8217;m feeling pretty good, but figured I&#8217;d be proactive.
