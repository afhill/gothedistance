_Thanks for thinking about us as your first ultra!</p> 

The course is like this:  
Start/Finish is at Boston Store  
Run the Brandywine Falls Loop = 5 mile  
Boston Store to Pine Lane Loop = 8 mile Total = 13 mile  
Run Brandywine Falls Loop = 5 mile Total = 18 mile  
Run Pine Lane Loop = 8 mile Total = 26 mile  
Run Brandywine Falls loop = 5 mile Total = 31 mile

We elected to move the Start/Finish to Boston Store:  
1. electricity  
2. heated bathrooms  
3. easy access for all runners at all times  
Last year we had 12&#8243;+ of snow and several runners wanted to change shoes, add clothes, ditch clothes, etc. So this should make it easier to account for runners as well as drop bags.

We do not have access to a credit card machine so I think the answer to your payment question is-payment only by mail-check or money order-please do not send cash!

Hints: you may want to bring more than one pair of sox and shoes.  
Each loop (Brandywine and Pine Lane) has a creek crossing. Depending on the weather you may be able to walk across both on hardened ice OR have to skip from stone to stone if there is no ice (like today) or thin ice.  
Also maybe a drop bag-be sure to put your name on it so you can add and take off clothes.

We&#8217;ll have chili and hot beverages at the finish.

The main thing about running an ultra is just keep moving at your own pace.  
We&#8217;ll do everything we can to support you.

Good Luck!
