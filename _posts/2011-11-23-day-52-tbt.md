I feel like I&#8217;m close to giving up on this tracking thing. TBT as a movement was fun, now I feel like I&#8217;m not achieving anything. I loved the community aspect of support and gathering ideas but that&#8217;s missing anymore. I don&#8217;t particularly feel accountable to anyone. I was prepared to make today a cheat day but I didn&#8217;t want to eat crap and feel accordingly. I was actually on edge today (I think a touch of dehydration) and craved sweets and caffeine, but steered clear
