I&#8217;ve never really made a bucket list &#8211; there are several things I&#8217;ve said I want to do, but I&#8217;ve never formally set them up as goals. 

EDIT: going back and looking at what I wrote, perhaps I should call this my athletic BHAGs, as this is definitely an ambitious list!

One of the surgeons I saw before my surgery (the one who referred to my 50 miles per week as &#8220;jogging&#8221; and said I may not get back to that level) took xrays. So I&#8217;ve injured my right knee twice in the past two years and have always only gotten MRIs of that specific joint. So these Xrays that showed both legs were a bit of a surprise.

It&#8217;s been.. wow, 19!.. years since I broke my left femur and patella. Since then I&#8217;ve run over 30 marathons, 20 half-marathons, and played roller derby for several years. I haven&#8217;t been held back at all! 

Except.. the Xray reminded me of that trauma. See, when you look at an Xray, your nice strong bone is a shining white. My left leg was a muted color, and showed definite signs of abuse. The doctor actually had to tell me to focus on the right, which looked much better than my &#8220;good&#8221; leg. 

It wasn&#8217;t his caution that I may never be able to jog at the same level again that caused me to grow silent and somber as I left his office: it was that xray. The mysterious vision that although my injury hasn&#8217;t held me back **_so far_**, that may not always be the case. 

Two years ago when I heard I&#8217;d partially torn my PCL, and may need surgery, I called my parents crying and basically decided my time playing roller derby was coming to an end. It wasn&#8217;t worth it. It wasn&#8217;t worth risking needing surgery and having to give up running. 

This time? Well, I didn&#8217;t have derby to blame! But I also didn&#8217;t blame running. Or think I should take things easy. No, as I stood there waiting for the elevator (it&#8217;s been 46 days since I could walk down stairs), I realized that I can&#8217;t keep thinking that I should put things off. Because I&#8217;ve had 19 great years, but will I have 29 or 39 more? 

Which is a really long way of saying, I&#8217;m going to write up a list. And work towards checking things off. Because someday I may not be able to. 

No particular order:

  * [New York City Marathon](http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/) (hopefully this November!!)
  * [Tahoe Triple](http://www.laketahoemarathon.com/ultra.html)
  * [Leadville 100](http://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/page/show/311976-leadville-trail-100-run)
  * an [](t)Ironman
  * [Canadian Death Race](http://www.canadiandeathrace.com/) (not sure if I want to do it solo or as a team)
  * break 3 hours in the marathon
  * completing a marathon in every state (ideally, [sub-4!](http://www.50sub4.com/))

That&#8217;s it for now. There are a few others I&#8217;ve talked about (Berlin, the Marathon du Medoc) but I&#8217;m not quite sure they&#8217;re bucket-list material. We&#8217;ll keep it more like a cup for now &#8211; although I&#8217;ve certainly not set myself anything really simple to accomplish!
