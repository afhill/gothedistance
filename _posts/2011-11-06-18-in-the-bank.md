So with starting to run with a few different running groups, I&#8217;ve more or less abandoned my &#8220;Run Less Run Faster&#8221; training plan. I&#8217;m getting in some good workouts, so I&#8217;m not too worried about that, but the long runs need to take place!

This morning was the New York City Marathon, so I watched quite a bit online and then this afternoon headed out for a long run. 

It was nice and sunny, and I got away with shorts and a long-sleeved shirt. I brought my waist pack, a water bottle, my homemade energy gel, and my iPhone and headphones. I drove down to the Highline Canal trail close by my old apartment, scenic and easier on the legs. 

I don&#8217;t often run with music, but it&#8217;s sorta a must on long runs. I listened to Sugarland for the first few miles, and concentrated on keeping my pace nice and easy. By about the 5th mile, I decided I wanted to go for 18 miles today. I decided it was more important to run steady and stay feeling good than hit any specific pace. 

After awhile, the country just wasn&#8217;t doing it, so I put on a song I&#8217;ve been meaning to run to: the one-hour, seventeen-minute &#8220;[All Day](http://illegal-art.net/allday/)&#8221; by Girl Talk. Not only does it make me smile, there were a few samples that hit perfectly! I ran listening to that song from 7.62 to 16.25. Yes, about where my pace picked up. 

Music is weird; I generally find myself speeding up to match the beat, and it blocks me from my thoughts, but it&#8217;s a different type of run. I don&#8217;t feel as &#8220;in tune&#8221; with myself. But I guess that&#8217;s sorta the point. There were a few miles on the way back where I felt like I was just holding on, but the music kept me going. 

My energy gel tasted great and I actually ate quite a bit, as opposed to GU where I don&#8217;t have very much. However, it was a mess to try to eat. I think I want a small squeeze tube, something like a medium-sized toothpaste tube. I have no idea where to get one..

In the last few miles I was starting to fade (or so I thought) and it was getting dark, but I kept pushing. I honestly didn&#8217;t realize my pace until I downloaded it. I&#8217;m glad to get this distance on the books, as it gives me some good motivation and a base.
