A few times in the last few days I&#8217;ve asked myself if I should make that day my cheat day. Tonight I went to a burger joint my parents like (Merle&#8217;s in Littleton) and I thought about how good a beer would taste. And then I decide it&#8217;s not worth it. Sure, for special social events I&#8217;ll drink, but I won&#8217;t squander a cheat day on one beer with my parents (they themselves don&#8217;t drink). It&#8217;s very empowering to know I have that cheat day if I want it, but know I don&#8217;t need it.
