It&#8217;s been a bit quiet here on the training front: last week I traveled and worked a ton and didn&#8217;t get in the physical activity I needed to üôÅ Thankfully that meant I was raring to go on the weekend, when I did 16 on Saturday and then 7.4 on the trails on Sunday.

Then Tuesday was my speed day. It was a workout I&#8217;d done before:

10-20min warmup  
3x(1mi @ 7:02), 400m RI  
10min cooldown.

The speedwork would equate to a 42 second lap, and I set to it pretty easily. I had a few 43 second laps but overall I felt pretty strong. My heart rate did get up to 189 but I never felt like I was uncapable of the effort:

M1: 6:51  
M2: 6:54  
M3: 6:53

Overall: 46:31 for 5.5 miles.

Tomorrow I leave for Canada for the holidays. I&#8217;ll get in at least a run or two with Mom, although she&#8217;s training for the half so I really should put in a few more miles. Also, they have SNOW! Something I really haven&#8217;t had to deal with yet this year. Hopefully I can just enjoy the runs, even if I can&#8217;t get in the intensity I need.

Hard to believe the race is less than a month away!
