#### Food

  * protein pancakes (egg whites, oatmeal, cottage cheese), plus my usual breakfast culprits: mixed berries, protein powder, chia seed, flax seed, wheat germ
  * starbucks iced nf sf hazelnut latte &#8211; not good. Ive never been much of an artificial sweetener fan. 
  * trail mix
  * tofu veggie bowl
  * sugar snap peas
  * hard-boiled eggs
  * veggie burger on whole wheat, salad

#### Exercise

  * none- rest day out of lack of time rather than desire 

Today was my last full day at my old apartment. I was over there by 9:30 and was there til 6, other than a quick trip to goodwill. A few months ago, I would have included some fast food run (likely chipotle) to get me through. Instead, I packed a big bag of food and snacked (well, and ate leftovers from yesterday). I was glad to have food at the ready, and when my friend came to help me move and her daughter said she was hungry, I was happy to be able to offer up an apple. I did go out for dinner afterwards, but that was a social choice.
