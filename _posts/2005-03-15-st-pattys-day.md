This Thursday night I&#8217;m running the Brewmaster&#8217;s Gate 5K. I actually had wanted to run a 5K after Columbus, but it took me too long to recover, and so I&#8217;ve been trying to find a 5K to run before Boston, in case it takes as much recovery time. My 5K races have never been as good as I feel they could be, because I start way too fast and can&#8217;t sustain it. I think that even though I&#8217;ve been concentrating on distance, I&#8217;m just overall alot stronger than I have been, and hopefully can turn things around. Heck, just the fact that I could put out a 7:03 min mile at the end of the Columbus Winter Run 15 milers gives me alot of encouragement.

My past 5Ks have been pretty brutal in general. I go out way too fast, then die. Even though my PR IS when I had my fastest first mile, I think that was alot of luck and I&#8217;d do better to start off a bit slower and be able to kick it up at the end. Aiming for 7:00 &#8211; 7:10/mile would make me very happy.

Hell, Andy told me he expected me to PR, so I guess I have a challenge!
