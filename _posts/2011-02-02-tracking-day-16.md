Today I tried out &#8220;better bodies&#8221;, a local gym. Frida walked me through some shoulder and back stuff. I realized how much I stick to &#8220;what&#8217;s comfortable&#8221; instead of actually pushing myself! My arms/shoulders were feeling a little jello-y afterwards, but I actually feel like I DID something! Between the few shoulder exercises I&#8217;ve done through the wii and today, I feel like my arms/shoulders are already looking better.  
There were sooo many machines at BB, including my old favorite ab machine from California Fitness. I only had an hour and felt like I could have done more (as opposed to the rec center, where I&#8217;m totally bored after an hour).  
Tonight I skipped MHC practice to get in my PT exercises. (and wii active, but I accidentally redid yesterday&#8217;s workout) I have a lot of strengthening to do apart from just skating in a circle to get strong!
