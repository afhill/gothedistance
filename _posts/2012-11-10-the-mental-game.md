Race results are in. Sure enough, my friends ran great: the girls went 1-2-3F in the 10K (Annie winning outright), Rick took 2M in the 10K and Laura took 2nd in the 5K. I guess I&#8217;m really up there with them, I placed 3F in the 5K. But I feel like I quit&#8230; Because I did. 

Interestingly enough, my time was only 1second off my second fastest 5K ever. So even without pouring everything in on it, I had a decent result (20:44 &#8211; 6:41 pace). But because I wanted things to play out differently, I&#8217;m annoyed with myself. 

This isn&#8217;t anything new; I&#8217;ve struggled a lot with not being able to course-correct on the run. I need to figure out how to be strong enough to keep pushing just to see what I CAN do, even if its not my ideal. I know I can race faster than I have been. I&#8217;m my own worst opponent..
