Total distance: 152.42. I said a few weeks ago that I&#8217;d like to get up to 40mpw, so I have a bit of a ways to go in that. 

Two races:  
Flying Pig Marathon on 5/4  
UACA 5 Miler on 5/24  
Both were good efforts. Not PR-worthy, but I was satisfied with them both.

I ran 29 out of 31 days &#8211; I took off the day after the Flying Pig, and I forgot to run the following Monday! I also rode a fair amount.
