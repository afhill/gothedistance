So a local race organization here is looking for individuals to make up Team Run Wild for 2006. I emailed to inquire what was involved.

_Team Run Wild is a marketing vehicle for us and a way to put a team out there that represents Run Wild Racing with the highest level of character and integrity. I do not pick people forthe team based on athletic ability, but by other factors.</p> 

What RWR requires:  
1. Run our events through the year, which are free to you (NOT Charity based events that we manage like the Muirfield 5K)  
2. Run other running related events throughout the year wearing the team colors.  
3. Promote RWR events to your friends and other peers in the running.

What RWR provides:  
1. Free entries into RWR owned events (13 in 2006)  
2. Team Singlet to be worn in running events  
3. 20% discount to FrontRunner off of running shoes  
4. Other freebies as the come along&#8230;</i> 

And so I just sent in my application&#8230; wish me luck!

_**Your bio in regards to running**  
I’ve flirted with running forever. In elementary school, I joined the “running club” until I found out they ran before school (7am). That was too early for me. (At that time, my motivation was lacking!)</p> 

My junior high school wanted to be known for its track team, so they had all sorts of perks to joining. One of them was that you didn’t have to run during gym class, since you were running after school. I joined. I was a ‘distance’ runner, which at that time meant I ran the 2K. When the city finals came around, they surprised us all with a 3K course that none of us were prepared for. I busted out a 9th place overall and promptly hung up my running shoes. (that was in ’92 or so)

I rejoined the running world in 2001, I’m almost embarrassed to say, in an attempt to share an interest with my significant other. I quite enjoyed it, but was injured training for my first marathon in 2002. I took nearly a year and a half off. When I decided to start up again in 2004, the significant other was long gone, and it was now something I was doing for me. I haven’t looked back since!

My first marathon was the Columbus Marathon in 2004, where I qualified for Boston. In 2005, I ran 5 marathons in total, culminating with a three-marathons-in-three-weeks streak that included my PR race: 3:30:05 at the Steamtown Marathon in Scranton, PA.

This year I already have planned the Goofy Challenge in Disney World, my first 50K in AZ and Boston. I also want to work on my shorter distance races, as I spent most of 2004 with my goals firmly set on my fall marathon.

**Your PR’s in common distances**  
5K: 21:56  
10K: 47:51  
13.1: 1:42:05  
26.2: 3:30:05

**Your running goals or aspirations**  
To run injury-free for a long, long time. To continue to experiment with different types of running and training. To serve as a role model for friends and others interested in the sport. To run a qualifying time for the NYCM (1:34 half or 3:18 full marathon). To do the Endurrun stage race and the Tahoe Triple. To become more comfortable with shorter distance races and not feel like my lungs are going to explode.

**Why you would like to run with Team Run Wild**  
The No Limits 10K was the first Run Wild Racing race I’ve done, and I was very impressed by the organization. I love the idea of the Grand Prix and was already considering it anyway for 2006. I’ve mulled over the bios of the team from last year and actually paid attention to people’s performances in other events (I was looing for a friends’ race results at the New Vegas Marathon and noticed Debi Wilch’s name from the thousands listed!) I love the idea of becoming part of a team of runners &#8211; I have my core group of friends who run but would appreciate the opportunity to become more a part of the community.

I am a dedicated runner who would proudly represent what I consider a fine race organization. I currently spend far too much time on the runnersworld forums, encouraging others and offering my own advice and experiences. I love the idea of serving as a role model for others interested in running. Serving on Team Run Wild could offer me another venue to serve as an ambassador for my sport.</i>
