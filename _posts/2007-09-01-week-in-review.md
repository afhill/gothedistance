I last wrote on Wednesday, when the gang was supposed to meet for 15 miles. It was a disgustingly hot day, and we all cut it short&#8230; really short. We covered about 9 miles, although my garmin shows 8:83 because I stopped it as we walked. So.. a bit under what I&#8217;d been hoping for..

I decided to put in a few more miles the next day, take Friday off, do a short run on Saturday to prepare for my Sunday race and Monday long run. I readily admit that not following the precise schedule makes me uneasy. I hope next week I can transition back into my established training schedule to finish it off-

Thursday morning I went out for a recovery run, and my average time was plenty lower than it has been- it felt good to be out there again! 

Today I headed to Sharon Woods for 4miles with strides. I&#8217;d simply adjusted a workout on my garmin I already had stored, which ended up having me do 8 strides instead of 6. I felt really good, really strong. I had to force myself to slow down when I hit the first half mile at 7:31.. As I look back at my schedule, I see it was supposed to be &#8220;recovery and speed&#8217; &#8211; definitely forgot about the recovery aspect of it&#8230;

Strides  
1: 5:26  
2: 5:47  
3: 5:43  
4: 5:29  
5: 4:55  
6: 5:30  
7: 5:17  
8: 5:44

My overall pace was 8:33, not bad considering I walked for a bit between every stride. The run left me feeling good, and eager for the race tomorrow!
