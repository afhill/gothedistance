Today was a hero workout. The coach told us there was a 35 minute max. Whoa!

Running with a medicine ball is..challenging. Awkward above all.  
The pull-ups were supposed to be hard, so I thought I&#8217;d try some kipping first (no weight). After only about 4 I grabbed the vest and a band to try to get through the rest. For the chest-to-bar pull-ups, the two bands (no vest) seemed almost TOO easy, so I dropped down to a single band. I&#8217;d grabbed my gloves today, which I think helped a lot in helping me sustain my grip. 

My finish time was 20:38. I tried some more kipping pullups on their own afterwards. I can get a few down but I still definitely feel like I&#8217;m using a lot of arm strength. (My forearms were actually tired)

Great workout! So strange how burpees can tire you out, I was breathing hard right off the bat! 

Afterwards I rolled out my back with the rumble roller, but I know my lats are going to be sore tomorrow!!
