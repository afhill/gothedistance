So my new year&#8217;s resolution is to run at least a mile every day. I do reserve the right to take the day off after marathons if need be.

It&#8217;s Jan 2nd, and so far, so good ðŸ™‚ I&#8217;ll admit, leaving work at 9pm after a 12 hr workday, it was hard to drag myself to the gym to get in that one silly mile, but it felt good. It was actually a good motivator to get me to the gym, where I want to start doing some more cross-training/strength-training to supplement the running. 

I really do enjoy working out in the evening, when the gym is quiet. I was only disappointed to find out they close at 10, so I didn&#8217;t really get in too much of a workout..
