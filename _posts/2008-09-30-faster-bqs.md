Last year was the first year I recall the Boston Marathon actually filled up. This year, they are anticipating meeting the registration cap by January.

I re-qualified last year at Boston, running 3:36:08. However, I have my eyes on a big PR at the Rock and Roll Arizona race in January. I was conflicted; do I register now to ensure I get in, or wait until I have that faster time?

I contacted the BAA, and their response was as follows:

> If you achieve a faster time, please notify us by February 13, 2009 so we may update your registration.
> 
> We cannot update qualifying times after February 13th.

So, I can go ahead and register to ensure the hotel I&#8217;ve already booked doesn&#8217;t go to waste!
