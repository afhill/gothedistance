Day 90! Cheat day! Picture day!

I have completely lost my taste for Starbucks mochas with hazelnut. It actually makes me a bit sad..

Got plenty o complements at the bout, including a guy who runs a crossfit gym and inquired about sponsoring my team. Sweet! Unfortunately it&#8217;s out of town so we&#8217;ll see what comes of it. It&#8217;s weird to think the program is &#8220;done&#8221; because I don&#8217;t really think I&#8217;ll stop. Its just funny because right now when I get complements on my physique, I tell them about the program. I guess I can&#8217;t really do that anymore. My 90 day transformation is as complete as it could be. Now I&#8217;m just someone who eats heathy and lifts ðŸ™‚

Oh- measured my weight and body fat when I got to the gym. Weight 117.2 (so, at my stable adult weight), but my body fat read 15.2&#8230; Quite a bit higher than last time! So I did my workout and then measured again: 12.2. Better&#8230; But really makes me realize what a joke those machines are.
