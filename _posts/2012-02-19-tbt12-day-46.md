I felt better today after taking in more fat (and calories?) on Saturday. I realized that once I started juicing daily, I&#8217;ve given up my smoothies, which had more protein. I should get back to that.. And protein from real food (Greek yogurt, egg whites) rather than powders. 

#### Food

Ezekiel cereal with kefir, hemp seed  
Beet, carrot, spinach, ginger juice  
Electrolyte hydrator on the run  
Smoothie: coconut milk, pb, banana, chia seeds, vega chocolate protein powder  
Superpump pre-workoung  
Monster Aminos post-workoung  
Vega endurance bar  
Nori roll with brown basmati rice, cucumber and avocado  
White bean and kale soup, hemp bread  
Kale chips  
Greek yogurt with muesli 

#### Exercise

Met KJ for part of her long run. (I did 12, she did 19) Wasn&#8217;t feeling great, but I got through it. Afterwards I went to Recovery Club. I was seriously limping up the stairs. After rolling, compressing, inverting and being on the balance board, I felt better. I then went to the gym.

I can&#8217;t seem to get my 30x65lbs, which is discouraging. Yet I stayed at the gym and still tried to get a good workout in. The highlight was doing 50 bosu pushups in a row! I spent the time doing the Fleetly lower body stretch program, which also helped a lot.
