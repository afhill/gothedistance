After nearly a month of [limping around](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2013/05/update-nothing-to-update/ "Update: nothing to update"), I had self-diagnosed a meniscal tear requiring surgery. Well, I was half right. Turns out my meniscus is fine.. but that&#8217;s about it. 

I&#8217;m still digesting this info, but here&#8217;s the official radiologist impressions:

>   1. Full-thickness cartilage defect from the central weight-bearing portion of the lateral femoral condyle measuring 6 x 9 mm which may include a thin rim of cortex and is displaced anterior to the distal anterior cruciate ligament. reactive subarticular bone marrow edema.
>   2. Partial tear distal posterior cruciate ligament
>   3. Grade II to III articular cartilage disease patellofemoral compartment, more severe in the lateral facet of the patella. Minimal tendinopathy proximal patellar tendon.

So&#8230;. basically, I broke off part of my cartilage. (I could see it on the images the doc showed me, although I can&#8217;t get the same resolution here) As we&#8217;ve all heard before, cartilage doesn&#8217;t really spontaneously heal itself. We need to &#8216;help it&#8217;, so I&#8217;ll undergo surgery (also, to get my floater out!). The common approach is microfracture surgery &#8211; &#8220;an articular cartilage repair surgical technique that works by creating tiny fractures in the underlying bone. This causes new cartilage to develop from a so-called super-clot.&#8221;

The recovery post-surgery is 6 weeks non-weight-bearing, which is sorta a drag but I was non-weight bearing for 16 weeks after my other leg surgery, so this&#8217;ll be a cakewalk! I asked about the New York Marathon, and she seemed to think I&#8217;d be fine if I went ahead and got it taken care of now. Of course this puts a major damper on a lot of summer plans, but I&#8217;m trying to focus on the positive.. and just accept the situation as it is. 

Given the fact it&#8217;d been nearly a month and I wasn&#8217;t really seeing marked improvement, I was mentally trying to prepare myself for surgery. Turns out I didn&#8217;t quite do a good enough job, but at least I started. I decided that since I can&#8217;t run, rock-climb or do cross-fit, this seems as good a time as any to work on that swimming thing! I&#8217;m not really comfortable with having my head underwater unless I have a SCUBA tank attached to my back, so I figure I may as well put my energies into learning something new I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise..
