Ok, so I guess it&#8217;s not a resolution if you start it on the 13th of the month, but oh well! It occurred to me that I&#8217;ve decided unofficially to start getting back into preparing more meals, and I know I do best with accountability. So here goes &#8211; I&#8217;ll prepare (and track) 52 new recipes in 2013, so averaging one new recipe a week.

Up until two years ago, I HATED cooking. It took too long, I had no confidence, half the time by the time I cooked something I wasn&#8217;t hungry/the smell grossed me out/whatever whatever. Then I started eating clean, and vegetarian/vegan, and things changed. I started to ENJOY cooking; crafting healthy tasty food. Now I really enjoy it, and this is just that one tiny nudge to encourage me to do something I enjoy. Everything I prepare will be vegan and gluten-free, meaning no eggs, no dairy, no wheat. And probably no white sugar. Ideally there won&#8217;t be a ton of sweeteners in what I make, but now and then I may use some agave.

I&#8217;ve already gotten off to a good start! Which is great because I expect there will be plenty of weeks where I won&#8217;t have the time to do anything.

    <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/tofu-vindaloo/">Tofu Vindaloo</a> &#8211; We went to Savory Spice Shop one afternoon and I picked up some interesting vindaloo seasoning. So of course then I needed to figure out what to do with it! This recipe was really, really good. Also, I was a goofball while making it and kept singing &#8220;Tofu Vindaloo&#8221; to the tune of &#8220;Brown Girl in the Ring&#8221;.

    <a href="http://www.vegangela.com/2012/12/18/spinach-lemon-quinoa-bake/">Spinach Lemon Quinoa Bake</a> &#8211; This sounded great, but I got part way through the recipe when I realized I only had about half the Spinach I needed. I went ahead and made it anyway, but it ended up just tasting yucky and too sour-creamy. As it is, I had to go out and buy vegan sour cream to make this recipe because I don&#8217;t really like that sort of processed crap, so I think I was particularly sensitive to something tasting like that. I won&#8217;t be trying this one again!

    Carrot Ginger Soup &#8211; this was a recipe I got from my Mom. Very carroty-lemony-gingery, and then I added hemp seeds. Surprisingly filling and refreshing
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://veganforeveryone.com/recipes/mushroom-mattar/">Mushroom Mattar</a> is something new I&#8217;ve been enjoying at a local restaurant, so I decided to try it myself. Oddly enough, when I get it at the restaurant I have to pay extra for coconut milk (instead of regular cream?) but this recipe didnt have either. I did add some coconut milk but the end result wasn&#8217;t quite what I&#8217;ve had before. Still, it was tasty and had a nice hardy feel to it.

    My plan is to update this thread with recipes as I try them, so I have one definitive list at the end of the year. Looking forward to it!
