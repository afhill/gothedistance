when I went to turn my garmin on before I got on the treadmill on Tuesday, it said the battery was low. 12 minutes into the run, it died. I charged it up, and yesterday Meredith and I ran for close to an hour, and all was fine. I went to hit the treadmill again this evening, and the watch didn&#8217;t respond at all. I thought it was odd that the battery would be completely dead. 

I took it home and threw it on the charger: nothing. 

I googled the problem, and evidently sometimes garmins go into &#8220;hibernation&#8221;, and holding down on/off and mode for 10 seconds can fix the problem. Tried that.. nothing. 

In a last ditch effort, I read that perhaps it had frozen during charging, and needed at least three hours of charging to rememdy itself. So all evening my poor garmin has been charging (without the cheerful &#8220;battery charging in progress&#8221; message I&#8217;d be hoping to see), and just now I went to turn it on, and it seems ok. Shew, that&#8217;s a relief! 

A friend was asking if the batteries are hard to replace; they&#8217;re integrated. No battery &#8211; no garmin.

Ha, perhaps my garmin (Gary? yes.. I believe his name will henceforth be Gary) dislikes the treadmill as much as I do!

Actually, it seems when I plug the garmin into my mac, it turns on; with the PC it just said &#8220;battery charging in progress&#8221;. So it&#8217;s not a big deal if it&#8217;s on while on the charger, but I guess I have to be more careful about ensuring it&#8217;s turned off once I take it off the cradle..
