This morning I had physical therapy: he said I can go down to once a week, and I&#8217;m cleared for contact at derby and a five mile race tomorrow. As I warmed up on the elliptical I actually felt the effects of yesterday&#8217;s workout (a hard three mike run, then 15 min on the elliptical/stair climber at the gym)- feels good to get the ole legs working!

After work I headed to boot camp. It was a partner workout: we did 4 exercises for 5 minutes each, ending each with 10 malligators and then a minute recovery. The exercises were: a sprint relay, alternating 15 pullups/rows, bear crawls and burpees with forward jumps. I wore my hrm for the first time, and the sprints were a good application for it! I got up to 181, although my average heart rate for the entire 35min workout was 135. Because this was a partner workout, there was much more rest than normal. 

Things are coming together in my head about my fitness plan. I expect some of it will be a work-in-progress but I have some pretty good resolutions in mind. 

The past month+ of tracking has helped me know what I&#8217;m capable of, nutrition as well as exercise-wise. It&#8217;s so crazy to think that for 15 years I&#8217;ve been so afraid of working my left leg and hurting my knee. Giving myself the time and permission to actually work on it has made a tremendous difference in my physical and mental fortitude. I still had a silly moment of irrationalibility at the gym the other day when I started to do a weighted calf lift (I think that&#8217;s what it was) but I know I can -and will &#8211; work to make both legs strong.
