</div>I went to bed really early last night, and woke up a few times during the night but actually didn&#8217;t get up til after 6 for the 

[Fight for Air Stair Climb](http://www.lung.org/pledge-events/co/denver-climb-fy12/). I was going to be on an elite team and I was actually nervous about it!

Before the climb I had hemp fourteener toast with peanut butter and hemp seed, a couple bites of cottage cheese and some beet, cucumber, apple and spinach juice (I made a double batch last night &#8211; I read that beet juice is good pre-exercise as it&#8217;s high in potassium). Also unsweetened Bhakti chai and unsweetened coconut milk, and a touch of honey. It was decent, not as good as the sweet stuff of course! I actually have a [full race report on the climb](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/02/fight-for-air-stair-climb-2012-race-report/ "Fight for Air Stair Climb 2012 Race Report"), so I won&#8217;t go into details. 

I had an apple, banana and a mojo bar sample after the climb (sadly, the Melting Pot wasn&#8217;t there this year), and then headed home. I had a honeymilk, changed and within a half hour KJ showed up for our &#8220;long&#8221; run. She had 20 to do, I had 12-16, so she ran a little over 7 before picking me up and we did just shy of 13 miles together. I felt really crummy: my neck and upper back felt stiff and it felt tough on the ole lungs. Granted, it was also a super windy day today so it wasn&#8217;t the easiest conditions. I was surprised to see that my heart rate averaged 144 and maxed at 157, I felt like I was working harder than that! In all we did 12.78 miles together in 1:58. 

I stuffed some food into myself as fast as I could (chickpea broccoli casserole, the last of those popcorn chips and a bunch of raisins) and went to Recovery. I decided today was the day I&#8217;d try the ice bath!

Got to the club and another gal was getting in the tub so I used the stick, and did some cold laser/TENS on my left knee. Then it was my time for the tub (48degrees). There are bricks in the tub so that your upper body isn&#8217;t in the water, and in fact the woman at the front told me it&#8217;s best not to be completely submerged as it lowers your body temp too much and sorta defeats the purpose. Corey from the club brought me a nice warm tea and after the initial shock I actually enjoyed the chilly water on my poor legs. In my race bag from the morning had been a copy of Competitor magazine, so I read that and waited for my phone to let me know the ten minutes were up. I dried off and changed, and sadly all the compression boots were being used. So I stood on the balance board for awhile, and then they freed up so I compressed my poor legs for 30 minutes. I got back to reading my [Why We Get Fat](http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307272702) book (I have notes about the role of insulin and cortisol and things to think about). Between the ice bath and the compression boots, I was feeling SOOO much better! I did a little stint on the inversion table and rolled out my hips with the rumble roller, and honestly felt so much better (mentally as well as physically) than an hour earlier! I had a Vega sport protein drink as well. 

I stopped at the little Greek cafe nearby for grilled veggies in a whole wheat pita, then drove home. Back at home I started to make dinner, and had some cheese and multi-seed crackers as I prepared it. I felt guilty and deviant, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to prevent me from having it. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m not motivated this time. Perhaps because I know I CAN do the TBT, so the challenge isn&#8217;t there? And today I just felt like I couldn&#8217;t eat enough! I am ramping up my miles like crazy and part of me doesn&#8217;t want to not eat if my body needs it.

The dinner I made was great, baked tofu in a [lemon tahini marinade](http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/saucesandmarinades/r/lemontahinisauc.htm) with brown basmati rice and steamed broccoli. Go me! Then a handful of blueberries for dessert.

Then I did 41 (real) pushups without stopping. Can&#8217;t forget about the bench press for Sunday&#8230; 

I can&#8217;t believe the Pump and Run is next week! I am trying to figure out what to do for run training this week &#8211; my flight Friday is at 9am, which means leaving for the airport at 7, which means little chance of a run before that. I&#8217;ll obviously miss my group workout on Saturday and my long workout on Sunday. While my pride likes that I&#8217;ve hit 50 miles the past two weeks, I need to decide how important it is for me to try to keep my mileage up or if I should do a real taper for this as it is an important event for me. If you&#8217;d asked me halfway through my run with KJ today, I probably would have said I needed to step back, but I feel a lot better now. 

I originally posted this entry with plans to run 5 times before Friday, around 30 miles. I&#8217;m going to scale that back and honestly try to run this race right. I just saw that our Tues workout seems perfect to prepare me for my race and I want to be fresh and fast come Sunday.

I&#8217;m now thinking tomorrow can be a rest day, group workout Tuesday, 4 Wed morning, Roost run (hard 6) Wed night, then an easy 6/8 Thurs, nothing Friday, easy 5 with some pickups on Sat. Hmmm.. decisions!
