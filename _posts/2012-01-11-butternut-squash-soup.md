It&#8217;s a snowy night here in Denver and I have a sore throat, so I decided some nice warm soup would be great. I&#8217;m trying to stay away from packaged soups so I did a quick search for &#8220;clean butternut squash soup&#8221; and came across [some inspiration](http://www.thegraciouspantry.com/clean-eating-butternut-squash-soup-with-coconut-milk-and-cilantro/).

Coconut milk and cilantro sounded simple enough, but I really wanted something more savory. I associate cilantro with a freshness and I wanted something more rich. So I did the following:

&#8211; 1 butternut squash (just cut in half, scooped out seeds, put it covered in the microwave for 8 min)  
&#8211; 1/2 can coconut milk  
&#8211; 1 cup vegetable broth  
&#8211; ginger, nutmeg, clove powder

Blended the above in the food processor, then put it on the stove to warm, added cinnamon, a touch of turmeric, a touch of cayenne pepper and some star anise (probably not enough to make a difference, given the amount of time it was on the stove). 

I did use cilantro as a garnish and did add some nice flavour. 

Quick and hardy, yum!
