This weekend I went to an acupuncturist, I&#8217;d bought a deal off Living Social for a consult and treatment. He did some intake, asked about my activity level and nutrition. I rattled off my recent allergy test results and also stated I was a vegetarian. He asked why, if it was for ethical, religious or health reasons. I told him it was really for health. He then asked if I&#8217;d be willing to consider eating meat if he told me it would be better for me. I replied &#8220;probably not&#8221;. 

So, I guess that&#8217;s an answer for myself, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s NOT just health issues, because if it were, I&#8217;d be willing to go back if it were a health-based recommendation. I stuttered out some excuse about how I was &#8220;grossed out&#8221; by the treatment of animals to get them prepared for food. It wasn&#8217;t really an &#8220;animal cruelty&#8221; response, but it was something deeper than &#8220;I think it&#8217;s better to eat plants than animals&#8221;. Although I&#8217;ve said that I just see food as fuel, I guess it&#8217;s not all that simple.

I am nervous about my new diet, though. My last two races haven&#8217;t gone well, and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s related to some sort of deficiencies. I&#8217;m actually more concerned about the gluten than the animal products, though. Although you can&#8217;t really be carb-deficient.. and I am eating a lot of quinoa, rice and fruits and veggies.

The acupuncturist did say that a vegetarian diet is one that is cooling, and the body needs to expend extra energy heating the food you eat (I sorta think that is more raw than vegetarian, but I accepted what he was saying). Since I already expend a lot of energy with my workouts, I should be aware of the extra work my body has to do. 

I want to be healthy and strong and good for myself and I guess the world around me. I listened to a podcast the other day where the speaker discussed the idea of optimizing versus maximizing your performance. That sometimes there are trade-offs between health and performance, or other factors. I haven&#8217;t quite figured out yet where that line lays with me.
