I&#8217;m in San Jose today for work, so this morning I woke up early and hit the nearby Los Gatos Creek Trail for a run. I had to smile whenever I passed a native Californian; I was in shorts and a tshirt, and many of them were bundled up in long pants, a sweatshirt and a hat!

It was very humid and foggy in the morning, to the point where I could see ducks on the water, but the water and the sky blended together in a transparent mist. I ran along, marvelling at the different flora and fauna only a few hours from &#8220;home&#8221;. 

Every few days it appears I get some validation that training is going well. I set out for my run today, and easily fell into my &#8220;target easy pace&#8221; between 8:45 and 8:15:  
8:30, 8:40, 8:24, 8:17, 8:06, 8:07, 7:56, 8:04, 8:04.

I am so thankful that I am healthy and strong enough to do the running I do. I&#8217;m glad that I am able to get up day after day and pound the ground and feel happy and alive.
