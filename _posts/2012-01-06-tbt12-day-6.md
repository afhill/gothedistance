Today was the first day in probably two weeks I set my alarm (to go for a run). It was worth it!

I wish I were funnier. There are a lot of funny bloggers doing the TBT! Nope, I&#8217;m just a list-er. But maybe I&#8217;ll start putting a daily inspirational quote into these. That&#8217;s better than just a list and a photo, right??

#### Food

  * Ezekiel toast with almond butter and hemp seed
  * Whole foods breakfast burrito- whole wheat tortilla, eggs, potatoes, vegetarian green chili, pico, saut√©ed veggies, guacamole 
  * Apple
  * Green Tea
  * Probar 
  * Almonds
  * Stir-fried &#8220;veggies&#8221; &#8211; I got home to realize I only had eggplant and mushrooms! So I threw in green apple and chickpeas. Used a dash of my citrus habanero olive oil, and mint. Actually pretty good!
  * banana &#8220;ice cream&#8221; &#8211; frozen bananas, with just a touch of: almond milk, almond butter, vega whole food optimizer (chai flavor), cacao nibs. Blend em up and voila!

I didn&#8217;t eat as much as I would have liked today. I went into the office without packing a lunch and only had almonds at the ready. I thought the whole foods burrito would have held me, but I was pretty hungry by mid-afternoon but we were too slammed at work for me to rush out (and I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about many of the options nearby) 

#### Exercise

  * 4.37 mile run @ 9:08 pace. Still not feeling great.. but I keep telling myself that I&#8217;ll feel awesome in 9 days..! Last night I got my email confirmation from the marathon, I&#8217;ll be bib # 4446 if anyone wants to [track my progress](http://www.chevronhoustonmarathon.com/Marathon/Technology.cfm?SRed=1&). My goal is to run 3:19:59 next Sunday, which is close to a 10 minute improvement over my current best marathon. 

Also, I&#8217;m really glad [no one](http://fridabeater.wordpress.com/) has given me any grief over my HoneyMilk, because another case arrived today! (some silly Facebook giveaway)
