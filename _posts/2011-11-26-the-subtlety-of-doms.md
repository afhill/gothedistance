Today I set out to do a 20 miler. My folks were going to accompany me on bikes, so I&#8217;d have my own support crew! We realized in the morning we only had one container of GU chomps and no gel. We did have a couple clif bars and Mom suggested bringing along dried apricots but I thought that&#8217;d be really tough to digest on the run. 

We started out, and I felt pretty darned good. Within a mile, my Mom asked if I meant to be going as fast as I was for a long run. I looked at my watch and responded that I was suppose to be going faster! I picked it up after the first mile and then just clicked into gear. 

We were running down a canal close to their place and they warned me we&#8217;d have to stop for traffic as we crossed roads. Somehow we lucked out and managed to hit the streets as they were clear, time and again!

M1: 8:44  
M2: 8:09  
M3: 8:11  
M4: 8:03  
M5: 7:58

At mile 5 we decided to diverge from the canal and followed a sidewalk. This made my third different surface to run on: gravelly path, asphalt and concrete. It was more peaceful and the miles continued to tick away. I looked at my watch and was amazed at my heart rate.

When Meredith and I used to do &#8220;recovery&#8221; 12 mile runs on Wednesdays, we&#8217;d have to stay below 153 bpm. Initially that meant we were around 11mm, eventually I think we got up to 10mm. But recovery runs were nice and slow. I was pretty surprised to see at this point my heart rate was sitting below that fabled ceiling despite the fact I was pushing along at an 8:15mm.

M6: 8:04  
M7: 8:18 (trail was all but gone and we were just going over rocks)

Just shy of 8 miles our trail ran out so we started heading back. I&#8217;d told myself I wanted to do between 15 and 20 miles, but I was feeling so strong when we returned to the initial path we kept going out further. 

M8: 8:26 (more of the non-existent trail)  
M9: 8:03  
M10:8:07  
M11: 8:26  
M12: 8:16

Just shy of 12 we hit another big street and I figured we&#8217;d gone far enough to make an even 20. We turned around and WOW we were met with a ridiculous headwind. I remarked to my Mom that I didn&#8217;t realize the wind had been pushing us that much, she said that she felt it had just picked up. Maybe we were both fooling ourselves, but we&#8217;ll stick to that story! Regardless, it was tough going, and my GU chomps had run out. The rest of the run was going to be tough&#8230;

M13: 8:15  
M14: 8:14

At mile 13 we met up again with where we&#8217;d deviated from the original trail, and realized that we&#8217;d be back around 18 miles, not 20. Who knows how much that gave me an &#8220;escape plan&#8221;..

Although these splits look acceptable, it was tough. Also, my left leg was really starting to give me trouble. On my IT band I had a weird pinching sensation, almost as though the circulation was impaired. The last few miles were literally gutted out: I stopped once because I was simply out of gas, and asked for a clif bar (I&#8217;d originally said I didnt want something that required so much digestion on the run). Another time I stopped to stretch. A few moments to relax and I&#8217;d be able to get going again (and often Mom would remark that I&#8217;d pushed the pace up to a 7:30 or so right after restarting). I just wanted to be done. 

M15: 8:18  
M16: 8:13  
M17: 8:34

Finally I spied my parent&#8217;s street up ahead. I told myself to push it, and for a VERY brief second I wondered if I wanted to try to get in a bit more distance. Then we turned onto the sidewalk (at 17.97miles), still probably a half mile from home, and my knee said &#8220;enough!&#8221;. I ran a few last steps until I heard the most beautiful sound of my Garmin announcing another completed mile, and stopped. 

M18: 8:27

Total: 18 miles in 2:28 &#8211; 8:15 pace  
Average heart rate: 144  
Max heart rate: 160

I walked back to the house, and knew I needed a stretch and maybe a dip in the pool: it&#8217;d been a hard run. But&#8230; a 144 average heart rate? 160 max? How could this have possibly been considered a HARD run?

Um, because you ran a 41 minute 10K two days ago, Andrea. 

Yes, I think I just got my first dose of what Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness really is. Sure, the lack of nutrition could have also played a role, but I think the biggest limiting factor was just my poor legs. 

Around mile 15 I told my Mom I&#8217;d be content with the 18 and she offered to extend the run to get in the full 20. But I told her I&#8217;d been watching my pace and I didn&#8217;t want to walk it in. I wanted to have a good strong training run, not just jog in a couple miles just to have a mileage number on the books. As it was, the way my leg felt when I hit that concrete ultimately made the final decision for me, but I still think that it&#8217;s more important for me to feel I ran a consistent pace. 

All in all, it was a good run because I really feel I learned how one run can impact another. Although I&#8217;ve given up on the &#8220;Run Less Run Faster&#8221; plan, I understand the premise. Thursday&#8217;s hard effort changed today&#8217;s run. Which is ok &#8211; just something to consider.
