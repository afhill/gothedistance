met Meredith after work yesterday for 8 miles. My knees are still feeling great, despite the fact I am only taking glucosamine occassionally, but I had a few times where my quad was a little sore. Not bad, though, considering I&#8217;ve run 21 miles in the past four days, which is more than the last 6 weeks put together! 

I&#8217;m set to meet Helen after work on Friday, and she wants to run 10, then Saturday we&#8217;re running 12 at Highbanks. I&#8217;m definitely back in the saddle!
