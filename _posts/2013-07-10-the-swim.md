As I&#8217;m starting to \*ahem\* dive into triathlon, I know that swimming will require the most upfront time to get right.

I&#8217;m fine with water. As a kid, I spent every summer day at the pool &#8211; yet I never learned proper technique. I could dive to the bottom of the pool, but I held my nose. I got my advanced SCUBA certification years ago &#8211; but I had air strapped to my back.

Ok &#8211; so it&#8217;s not general swim technique I&#8217;m concerned about, it&#8217;s breathing. Not exactly a unique problem, I know.

A book I recently read ([Total Immersion](http://www.amazon.com/Total-Immersion-Revolutionary-Better-Faster/dp/0743253434)) mentioned that swimming is a skill-based sport like Tennis or golf. Whereas with cycling and running you can get better just through volume, swimming can really improve through specific drills and the honing of particular techniques.

How many times can one person write &#8220;technique&#8221; in a blog post?

So, although I&#8217;m still not cleared to hit the pool, I&#8217;ve been preparing myself mentally. Reading the book mentioned above, and watching the O2 in H2O DVD, also by Terry McLaughlin of Total Immersion. My [Physical Therapist](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2013/07/physical-therapy-day-1/ "Physical Therapy: Day 1") also lent me a swim book, although I haven&#8217;t cracked that one open yet. I&#8217;ve been practicing hand position and trying to practice body roll on dry land, although things will definitely be different when I&#8217;m actually trying to be buoyant.

Although I&#8217;m big on trying to figure things out on my own, I know I&#8217;d benefit from someone&#8217;s help, so I&#8217;ve also signed up with a lesson with a [local TI swim coach](http://www.swimbetter.co) in a few weeks. My plan is to try things out on my own for a few weeks, then get some pointers from him before I learn too many poor habits! I always like to try something on my own first, at my own pace.

After that, I may be confident enough to check out the local [Boulder Aquatic Masters](http://www.bamswimteam.org/) group. I know most folks find Masters classes to be a great place to learn, but I know I need that private time to figure things out at my own pace before jumping into something like that.

My plan is to hit up the pool a good 4-5 days per week in August and really try to nail the technique, and then I can start focusing increasing distance. I have my eye on the [Inverness Triathlon Aquabike](http://www.invernesstriathlon.com/) in September that I think could be enjoyable: a pool swim and a bike, what a great way to ease into multisport! (Although in general my run would be my strongest sport, I&#8217;ll probably just be getting back into it at that point post-surgery).

Any magical swim training tips you have to share?
