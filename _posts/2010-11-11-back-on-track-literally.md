Thursdays mean tempo workouts!  
Today&#8217;s schedule run was: 1 mile easy, 6 miles at 8:05, 1 mile easy. 

I really like the track at the rec center: the tenth mile track makes it easy to tick off the miles. My target pace per lap was 48 sec. Within 4 laps I tapped into that pace (actually 47 sec) and then just went on autopilot. Before I knew it, I&#8217;d finished 20 laps. Around 40 laps I felt my form slipping but stayed on pace. I guess I shouldn&#8217;t be too surprised: I&#8217;ve run entire marathons at a faster pace.. though not for a few years now&#8230;

I finished my 6 miles strong, my last two laps the fastest. Then I settled in for that last easy mile feeling content with a good effort and performance. 

8 miles in 1:06:04; 6 miles at 7:46

This weekend&#8217;s &#8220;long run&#8221; is only 13, it&#8217;s a fallback from last week&#8217;s 20 miler that I missed. Part of me wants to do more but I suppose being prudent isn&#8217;t a bad thing&#8230;
