How long have I been working on my kipping pull-ups? And today&#8217;s workout called for strict pull-ups! A gal can&#8217;t win!

> <For time: 
> 
>   * Run 800 meters
>   * 28 Kettlebell swings, 2 pood
>   * 28 Strict Pull-ups
>   * 28 Kettlebell clean and jerk, 2 pood
>   * 28 Strict Pull-ups
>   * Run 800 meters</blockquote>

> Because of the time I did doing Russian kettlebell work, I still struggle a bit with the American version, that brings the kettlebell all the way above your head. However in an attempt to overcome my bias, I did some reading about why the American version is ideal in terms of power. 
> 
> 2 pood is roughly 72 lbs. I did the swings at 1 pood (36#), and the clean and jerks at 25#.  
> For the pullups, I used two bands. I can do a few unassisted pullups, but there was no way I&#8217;d get through over 50 of them! I threw in a few chin-ups as well to mix it up. By the second set I was only getting through 2-3 at a time before resting.

> There was one girl in the class wearing a shirt from the Moab Relay &#8211; Crossfit Lodo put in team for a 70 mile relay this past weekend. The team averaged a 7:40 pace and came in 4th out of 100 &#8211; nice! She was a really well-rounded athlete &#8211; the fastest runner and then did heavy weights and unassisted pullups. Wowza! 
> 
> I came in at 19:38, which I was happy with. But I often feel a touch of remorse when I&#8217;m &#8220;first&#8221; in a workout, wondering if I should have used a heavier weight or less resistance. 
> 
> Afterwards we got in pairs and did 100 medicine ball pass sit-ups. Loren and I used a 14lber. I seemed unable to count.. huh?
> 
> This was my first &#8220;paid for&#8221; workout after my pass was over. Even though it&#8217;s not pleasurable to have to hand over cash before a workout (it&#8217;s easier to question &#8220;was that worth $X?&#8221;), I have sufficiently sipped the kool-aid to be content paying for pushing myself every Tuesday and Thursday. 
> 
> I was actually reflecting on it this morning as I headed home. Having to take a break after every pullup or two (but continuing to work your way through it) is so empowering. Back especially when I first started lifting, you&#8217;d lift until it seemed tough and then you&#8217;d stop. Here you push push push and no doubt see more gains physically as well as mentally.
