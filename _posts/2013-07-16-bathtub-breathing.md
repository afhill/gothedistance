One of the early drills in the [Total Immersion O2 in H2O](http://www.amazon.com/02-H20-Breathing-Immersion-Instructional/dp/B00120WGUO) DVD involves practicing breathing in a large bowl of water. You ease your way into it, letting your nose be in the water, then your open mouth. You get the chance to learn how little of your mouth needs to be out of the water for you to breathe. I tried this the other day at the pool and was actually surprised how comfortable I felt!

So today I took another step &#8211; I got in the bathtub and practiced! I&#8217;ve always had the tendency to hold my breath as I swim, so I focused on just getting used to always blowing out. I didn&#8217;t feel anxious or anything, and I tried to get used to bilateral breathing (although obviously I didn&#8217;t have a true body roll as I was sitting in the tub!) 

I still found I had a problem with my nose feeling blocked, and that made me realize that I think that&#8217;s my biggest concern of all when I swim. As a kid I used to always hold my nose when I jumped or dove into the water, it&#8217;s ALWAYS been a problem for me! 

Getting out of the tub, however, I did some quick research and realized that apparently I should be actually trying to breathe out through my nose! I&#8217;ve been doing all my breathing through my mouth, so my poor nose was left to its own devices. 

I&#8217;m glad I read this, but I&#8217;m almost tempted to go get back in the tub to try it out! 

Isn&#8217;t learning something new fun?? New progress every day!
