I have been assigned bib #1510 in the Paris Marathon, in the preferred corral.

\*nervous\*

I haven&#8217;t actually figured out the logistics of my BEING in Paris at this time. But I guess I have some time to work it out. The funny part is, my friends are struggling with paying hundreds of dollars a night for a hotel in Boston. I&#8217;ll be staying with a friend for free, so my trip may actually end up cheaper than theirs!
