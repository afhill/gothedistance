I got a little giddy rush of excitement this morning when I thought &#8220;the marathon this weekend&#8221;.

Last week N. was telling me about this girl she thought was attractive. She&#8217;d seen her running around Goodale, and on Tuesday she stopped her to introduce herself (when she recounted this story, I was thinking about how annoyed I would be if someone stopped me when I was running). Anyway, she and C. exchanged email addresses, and were going to go to Gallery Hop on Saturday night with some of C&#8217;s friends. Originally I wasn&#8217;t going to meet up with them, but my power went out so I figured I might as well. We met up, and C. and I started talking about running and such. She runs 6 days a week, only ~5 miles at a time, because she has a herniated disk in her back. I guess she&#8217;s not really supposed to run at all, but she likes it too much. Anyway, we decided to meet up, since her pace is roughly what I do my recovery runs at (she ran the A&F 5K in 28:xx the other day). We met up last night and ran around Goodale for close to an hour. It was cool to have someone to run with; this year I really haven&#8217;t been running with &#8216;the group&#8217; very much and it was cool to pass the time chatting. 

I felt bad for N, since as soon as I showed up Sat C and I started talking and she was sorta left out, but I guess that&#8217;s what happens when people have a shared passion ðŸ™‚
