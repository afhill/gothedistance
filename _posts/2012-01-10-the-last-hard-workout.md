There&#8217;s something special about the last hard workout before a race. It&#8217;s a chance to test out any new gear, and get mentally ready for the event. 

My coach Darren asked the marathoners to join the early group today. Generally I consider the early group=the fast group: today we ran with Colleen De Reuck, Katie Blackett and Joanna Zeiger, who are preparing for THEIR marathon on Saturday, a little event know as the Olympic Trials! (Story about them [in the Daily Camera](http://www.dailycamera.com/recreation-columnists/ci_19707567)).

We warmed up and then ran 4&#215;5:00 at marathon pace. This time I ran with Lydia (who&#8217;s aiming for a 3:10) with a goal of 7:15s. I messed up my watch on the first one, but the next three went 7:09, 7:00, 6:58. It was definitely tough not to give chase and keep our pace where it was supposed to be &#8211; even with our pace slightly fast, that was a lot of forcing ourselves to slow down! 

What a great way to get ready for the race! I felt really strong, and while I know we only did 20 minutes at race pace, it felt pretty good. 

Now I&#8217;m eager to run, and I know it&#8217;ll be tough to reign it in this week to taper. The group is meeting up for a light run Saturday afternoon, and then it&#8217;s game time!
