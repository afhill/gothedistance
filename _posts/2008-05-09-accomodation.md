After the interesting accommodations in Boston, I&#8217;m all about booking early to ensure I get a good place. I haven&#8217;t even been accepted into NYCM, but I&#8217;m shopping! The problem is, I&#8217;m hoping I will have someone to share a room with, and I don&#8217;t know how long to book for. It IS New York, after all! 

There is an official transportation listing, and I have my eye on one of the hotels. There is a $25 cancellation fee before September, so if I just had some idea how long to book for, I&#8217;d be tempted to go ahead and grab it before the official lottery announcements come out. Better to throw away $25 than have to spend several hundred more per night&#8230;
