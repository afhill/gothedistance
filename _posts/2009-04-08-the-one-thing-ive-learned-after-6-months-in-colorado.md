&#8230;is that running is never easy.

You&#8217;d think that I&#8217;d be used to it, but no. Even 6 months of running at 5600ft, I still puff and pant at a nine minute mile. It&#8217;s frustrating, but I know I just need to realize that it&#8217;s not lack of fitness. 

I know it&#8217;s not all bad: I&#8217;m getting used to pushing when it&#8217;s hard. But I&#8217;m training my lungs, not my legs.

When I moved here I did some reading, and that seemed to be a general concern: training at altitude helps you in terms of getting used to running with less oxygen, but you never really get the chance to get used to leg turnover. I&#8217;m not training at the speeds I would be at lower altitudes.

Throw in the hills, which make even a trip around the neighbourhood a hill workout, and there&#8217;s no such thing as an &#8220;easy&#8221; run anymore! 

I suppose I have to look to my cross-training to help me &#8211; practicing leg turnover on the bike, and power on the derby track, And just get used to the mental toughness of pounding the pavement outside.
