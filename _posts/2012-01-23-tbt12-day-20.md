Ok, there&#8217;s starting to be some overkill with the &#8220;shit (people) say&#8221; videos. But this one is dead on. Pretty sure I&#8217;ve said most of these things:  


Short(er) workout today &#8211; I was still spent from yesterday! But I take &#8220;going to muscle exhaustion quickly&#8221; as a good sign! 

Tomorrow I get to run again! 

#### Exercise

&#8211; Hammer curls (dumbbells: 25lbs, 12lbs, 15lbs)  
&#8211; bicep curls on the cable machine (60lbs, 50lbs, 30lbs)  
&#8211; bosu pushups

#### Food

&#8211; Ezekiel English muffin with peanut butter and hemp seed  
&#8211; Vega pre-sport optimizer with BCAAs and Creatine  
&#8211; Vega sports protein with Creatine (I realized it actually has BCAAs in it)  
&#8211; Green juice: apple, cilantro, spinach, ginger, cucumber, celery, 1/2 cup water. Not as much as I&#8217;d like, because I managed to strip the gears on my blender. Awesome.  
&#8211; spelt tortilla with brown rice, black beans, tomato, avocado, cilantro  
&#8211; cinnamon loaf with earth balance. I have SO MUCH of this left!  
&#8211; apple with peanut butter  
&#8211; homemade protein bar  
&#8211; black bean and sweet potato tacos (white corn soft tortillas) with guacamole (from [watercourse](http://watercoursefoods.com/). Yum!)
