Yeah, I&#8217;m starting to feel like myself! Sadly it&#8217;s a mere 3 weeks til the Pikes Peak Marathon, but it&#8217;s almost like a switch flipped and I&#8217;m back to being the distance runner I know I&#8217;m meant to be. 

Sure, I haven&#8217;t really done a great job during the week, I&#8217;m still getting used to living in a city rather than BOULDER FREAKING COLORADO, but at least I&#8217;m putting in some time on the weekends. 

Yesterday I went down to the good ole Highline Canal and hammered out 12 miles. Sure, it&#8217;s not at the pace I used to, but I&#8217;m just so thankful that I finally feel like I&#8217;m not being held back by any sort of stupid knee issue. I felt wiped by the end but still managed a negative split. (9:19 pace / 9:13 pace)

Then today I went down to meet up with the Incline Club in Manitou. Everyone was headed up to the top to do the infamous 3-2-1 workout. I knew I wasn&#8217;t prepared for that, so I ended up doing 2.5-1. That&#8217;s starting up at 14,000 ft and going down 2.5 miles and then coming back up, and then going down 1 mile and coming back up. HARDEST 7 MILE WORKOUT EVER!

I was feeling a bit uncoordinated due to the elevation initially but already felt better the second time. So glad I went up there! I did lose $5 on the trail and lamented that that was my french fry money, so someone lent me some. It&#8217;s the little things!  
The downhill was rough on my poor toes &#8211; I felt like I was slamming them into my shoes pretty hard. As for shoes &#8211; I wore my new Hokas and they&#8217;re much more stiff than the last one. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about them, especially since I also twisted my silly left ankle. (Note: this has traditionally happened on my trail runs but I was really hoping that changing my gait would have &#8216;fixed&#8217; the problem). 

I loved that it was really just being up at altitude (and my toes) that made today a butt-kicker. Not my quads, not my knee. Just, you know, general fitness. Ha! But at least I can really start to feel like I can do some legitimate training and shake off the &#8216;recovering from injury&#8217; excuse. 

But only three weeks til the big show? oh man&#8230;..
