Sunday &#8211; AM run | PM derby  
Monday &#8211; AM yoga | PM run, derby  
Tuesday &#8211; PM run  
Wednesday &#8211; PM derby  
Thursday &#8211; PM run, derby  
Friday &#8211; AM yoga  
Saturday &#8211; AM run (and attempted bike ride until I realized [my bike was sick and needs repairs](http://twitpic.com/5ax7j)  
Sunday &#8211; AM run

&#8230;and I&#8217;m POOPED! It started shortly before I hit the trails this morning, I just felt a bit &#8220;off&#8221;. It&#8217;s not sluggish, it&#8217;s now really stuffed up as though I&#8217;m sick, it&#8217;s just &#8220;off&#8221;. After the run I came home and napped, which feels great but is not something I do often. 

I know the last couple weeks have been a bit over the top in terms of workouts and I certainly have earned a day off. But I have a marathon in three weeks, and my folks are coming later this week to visit, so I know my schedule will ease up while they&#8217;re here. 

The fact is, I&#8217;m an endorphin junkie. I think I love all the different athletic activities because I can only do one for so long. I first noticed it last year when I was biking with Melissa on Sunday mornings: I&#8217;d limit our rides to 20 miles, but then I&#8217;d throw on my running shoes as soon as I got home and hit the roads again. This year I&#8217;ve seen on several occasions that my best derby practices are after I put in a good run. This stuff isn&#8217;t &#8220;training&#8221; for me &#8211; it&#8217;s what I enjoy doing! Of course I know I need to stay healthy for it to be enjoyable, but I&#8217;m not quite ready to rest just yet&#8230;

(and with that, I probably officially jinxed myself!)
