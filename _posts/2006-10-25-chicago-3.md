Not even sure how I found reference to this fellow who took something like 300 pics during the marathon. Lo and behold, found one of me!

In the blue cap and the &#8220;QUALIFIED&#8221; shirt on. This is around mile 21.4. You can see the 3:30 pace group on my heels!

For anyone else who ran or wants to spot someone who did, go to http://mdraughn.smugmug.com/gallery/2040207/10/104997598. Instructions at the top will help you figure out roughly when you would occur in the galler.
