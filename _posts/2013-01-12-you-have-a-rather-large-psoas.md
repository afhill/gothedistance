Yesterday I had the best massage of my life. 

And by best, I mean the most squirm-inducing, intense massage I&#8217;ve ever had. 

My hip has been bothering me for awhile, and I just couldn&#8217;t get relief. Finally I decided to get a massage at [Fuelary](http://fuelary.com/) from Geoff Hower. He&#8217;d worked on me a few weeks prior and I knew he was up for the task I requested: &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping Geoff can make me cry like a girl and loosen things up&#8221;.

When I met with him, I explained that I really just felt super tight in and around my hip and glute area. &#8220;I just feel like I want to be stretched out &#8211; as though people grabbed my hands and feet and pulled things apart&#8221;. Geoff asked a few other questions about my specific area of concern, and we got started. 

I&#8217;ve never been one for relaxing massages &#8211; I go in to get worked over. Geoff went to it, working on my glutes, hips and back. He focused primarily on the right side that had been bothering me, but did pay some attention to the left side as well. He really dug in, and at one point I felt the pressure he was applying to my hip radiate down my leg. It was torture, but the sort of torture I had signed up for. I grabbed the table and willed myself not to ask him to lessen the pressure. 

He was not inattentive to how I was responding, and checked in a few times with me. I felt confident that he knew what he was doing, and it would make a difference. I just had to make it through the session.

At one point he asked if I&#8217;d had psoas work before. I wasn&#8217;t sure, and then once he started digging into my abs, I recalled that the owner of Fuelary, Josh Shadle, had done some psoas work on me before, and it had been really effective. Geoff dug deep into my abs, mentioning offhand that he was working my back, asking if it felt like he was hitting my small intestines.. In what I saw as an extremely funny statement, he told me delicately that I &#8220;had a rather large psoas&#8221;. Since I barely knew what the psoas was, I wasn&#8217;t sure if this was a complement or not! Either way, I felt a significant release in my hips and lower back as he worked on it. It was remarkable.

Eventually his work was over, and although it hadn&#8217;t been relaxing, I felt refreshed once I got up. His work (particularly on my psoas) had loosened things up in my back and hips immediately, and I actually felt taller, if that makes sense. The tightness over my hip bone seemed all but gone. I was astounded! 

Several hours later as I got ready for bed I noticed a pink spot on my abs where he&#8217;d worked on me. Wow &#8211; now that&#8217;s pressure! [granted, I have very sensitive skin]. While the massage wasn&#8217;t a complete cure-all, I feel significantly better than I did before, and I&#8217;m tempted to sign up for another session with him before my race next week. I&#8217;m only slightly exaggerating to say that the psoas work was life-changing, and I definitely recommend Geoff and Fuelary for their services!
