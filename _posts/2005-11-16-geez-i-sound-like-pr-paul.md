I have a friend who only recently started training. Before that, he only ran races on the weekends. It was kinda funny, but it seemed to work for him. I just responded to a qquestion by <lj user="katnyu002"> about racing during training, and Bridget emailed me about doing a marathon in February, and I started thinknig about all the races I&#8217;m considering for the Spring. 

Goofy Challenge: 01/07  
Winter 15 miler 01/29*  
Last Chance Half 02/26*  
Crown King Scramble 50K 03/18  
Cap City Half 04/01*  
Boston 04/18  
Flying Pig 05/07*

*possible

I don&#8217;t even want to think about all the money I&#8217;m going to spend..  
That just seems like a LOT of races.. I can definitely see myself dropping off the Flying Pig and maybe the Cap City Half since I didnt do it last year, but I&#8217;d like to keep a lot of those other runs, in part just b/c of tradition. Last Chance was my PR run, for pete&#8217;s sake! ðŸ™‚
