Two-thirds done! Although, honestly, if you go back to when I first started [tracking my food](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/01/a-semi-new-leaf/), I&#8217;ve surpassed my 90 days. And before I &#8216;officially&#8217; started the TBT, I&#8217;d planned to take it as a general lifestyle change, not a limited-duration program. But, progress checks are always good!

#### Food

  * Amazing meal pre-workout
  * Shake n go smoothie post-workout
  * Watermelon
  * Carrot bread
  * Ezekiel cereal with lowfat milk, hemp seed and strawberries
  * larabar
  * Green lentils with tomato quinoa, sugar snap peas
  * apple with peanut butter
  * trail mix
  * almond nut-thins
  * [vega sport performance protein](http://myvega.com/products/vega-sport-performance-protein/features-benefits)
  * green lentils with pita bread

#### Exercise

##### Morning

  * Front Squat: 4 sets of 6-8 repetitions (1&#215;140, 3&#215;160)
  * Stiff-legged Deadlift: 4 sets of 6-8 repetitions (50lbs, the heaviest ezbar they have in the women&#8217;s room. I need to go to the big weight room next time!)
  * My addition: square one-leg jumps 3x1min each side
  * Lunges onto bench: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions (20lbs)
  * Hamstring Curl: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions (30lbs. My legs crackled, especially as I got close to straightening them. Yuck! But it&#8217;s not painful so I pushed through, hoping this is actually going to help)
  * Standing Calf Raises: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions 300lbs. Too easy
  * My addition: leg extensions. I miss them! (4&#215;6-8 135lbs). Only got to 4 on my last set, so did 4 at 105. Trashed!

##### After work

  * 25 minutes of intervals on the bike. I meant to do a half-hour, but messed up in programming my watch
  * Endurance practice at derby, including 100 laps in 16:48. Then Gator made us sprint and squat. I may hate her a little. oh, and my heart rate got up to 180.

My lats are sore from yesterday! My Chiro had me lay back and put my arms above my head and I felt it! I guess I&#8217;m on my way to [blotting out the sun](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/get-mile-wide-5-move-plan-to-building-lats.html) (is that a common goal?)

The 11.7 in the title? Well, if I still weigh 113, that&#8217;s my body fat percentage as measured this morning at the gym. I&#8217;m not really sure that&#8217;s accurate, but I&#8217;m logging it! I also took 60 day pics for my wrap-up post.
