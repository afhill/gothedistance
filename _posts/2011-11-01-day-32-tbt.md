Day-counting just got more difficult! It was easy when the day of the month corresponded with the day of the program!  
Still a bit congested and snotty today, and after my run I was coughing but overall I&#8217;m feeling MUCH better!

Food  
&#8211; quinoa, hemp milk, hemp seed, chia seed, cinnamon  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; Van&#8217;s whole grain waffles with almond butter  
&#8211; Amy&#8217;s cheeseless veggie pizza (whole wheat crust)  
&#8211; salad with spinach, tomato, avocado, quorn chickn, edamame, balsamic vinegar. Yum!  
&#8211; vega sport performance optimizer  
&#8211; honeymilk  
&#8211; leftover butternut squash risotto  
&#8211; pb chickpea bar

Apparently today is World Vegan Day. I didn&#8217;t learn that til almost noon, and my waffles are sweetened with honey üôÅ Otherwise, I&#8217;d have been tempted to make the effort to be vegan for a day. Oh well..

Exercise:  
&#8211; 10.09 mile workout with the Running Republic of Boulder. It was sorta amazing, and got a [blog post of its very own](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/11/restarting-my-running/). I&#8217;ve long wanted to find a running group here and I think this is going to be it!
