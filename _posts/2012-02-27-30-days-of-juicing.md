On Jan 22nd, I started on a juicing kick. After a couple days I managed to break my blender and decided a real juicer was in order. I read about the differences between masticating and centrifugal juicers, and decided to go with the masticating. (Lower temperature, quieter, basically chews the veggies instead of just spinning them). Due to my limited counter space, I settled on the Omega Vert 350HD and haven’t looked back! Here’s a look at my 30 days of juicing!

At first I threw in a ton of ingredients, but I simplified as time went on. Fewer ingredients meant you could really taste the veggies that were in there. Also, after the unfortunate cauliflower and tomato incident, I decided to stick to actual recipes I found. 

I’ve identified a few great ingredients: cucumbers, beets and ginger are all delicious. I now buy bags of apples and carrots as a bit of a staple in my juices, as well as spinach. I&#8217;ve purposely tried to stick with organic, despite the cost. I figure if I am juicing as a way to improve my health, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to skimp on the ingredients.

If it takes a few weeks to form a habit, I&#8217;d say I have the juicing habit down! I think it&#8217;s a great way to get in some extra veggies, and it makes for a super refreshing afternoon beverage. It really doesn&#8217;t take long to prepare or clean up (a major concern I had), so I&#8217;d definitely recommend fresh juice for folks looking to get in a few more nutrients from real food.
