This was a good month: 

I hit over 100 miles, which I hadn&#8217;t done since May. I ran 19/31 days, and of course scored a big [3 min half marathon PR in Phoenix](rock-n-roll-arizona-half-marathon-race-report/). 

I liked how I&#8217;ve started mixing it up a bit, running some shorter harder days on the treadmill. I think it helps from a time as well a training standpoint. In February I&#8217;d like to continue to do this, but extend the distance. 

I&#8217;ve really liked having the weekend groups to run with, it helps keep me motivated. However, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the trails when they&#8217;re snowy.

Another metric to keep track of: my Mom gave me a scale for Christmas so I&#8217;ve been weighing myself nearly daily. I started the month at 118.3 and fluctuated up to 122.1 until settling at 117.7, where I am now.
