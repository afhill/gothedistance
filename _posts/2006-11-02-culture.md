It&#8217;s generally joked about the dominance of the Kenyans in the marathoning world. Yet the fastest woman is Paula Radcliffe, by over 3 or 5 minutes or something remarkable. Indeed, the top female runners in any given race come from a variety of countries, unlike on the men&#8217;s side. 

I know I&#8217;ve read about how the Kenyan men train together, which is also why in race pictures you can sometime see them running in a V, in essence drafting off one another. I&#8217;ve never seen such a thing on the women&#8217;s side. I don&#8217;t know enough bout the culture to know if women train differently over there or not, but it would be interesting to know if that helps account for the differences (there are definitely outstanding female Kenyan runners: Catherine Ndereba comes to mind. But they don&#8217;t dominate the sport as the men do).
