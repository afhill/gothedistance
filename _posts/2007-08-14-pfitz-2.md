As I mentioned, I am now into Mesocycle 2 of my training plan. In the first month (endurance phase), I missed one workout, swapping a couple of the days. I feel really strong &#8211; I feel I am going into every run fresh, and a few times have even had to convince myself NOT to run more than I am scheduled to (&#8216;days off&#8217; feel like they have something missing). 

The run I missed was one of those mid-week ones. I slept in on Monday and didnt have time to run a 10miler, so I did Tuesday&#8217;s recovery run. Then I took Tuesday off and did Monday&#8217;s 10miler on Wednesday. I think this was as good a &#8216;swap&#8217; as I could hope for: I still managed to keep my hard/easy schedule, and got in the dreaded LT run. I firmly believe that Wednesday runs are as much mental as they are physical, and I know I can do them. That being said, I do want to keep trying to hit the rest of my workouts as planned.

I don&#8217;t know what my marathon goal will be as it draws nearer. I definitely have a dream goal, but I know it will be a stretch..
