The other day some of the gals were going to a local wellness clinic for food allergy testing. Always curious about how to fine-tune this body of mine, I decided to go as well. We did the IgG 93 test. 

In speaking to some folks after and doing a bit of research, I&#8217;m less comfortable referring to it as a food allergy test, so I&#8217;m going to go with food sensitivity or food intolerance. Bah.. Yeah, semantics.. I know. :-/

Also, I stumbled upon an article yesterday that <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/03/19/148950092/to-find-out-about-food-allergies-first-use-the-right-test>pooh-poohed this test a little&#8230;</a>

I was lactose intolerant as a kid, so I was curious if that would show up again. Plus given the widespread discussion of gluten intolerance, I was curious what else might show up. Before I got my results back, I guessed dairy and (sweet) potato would show up.

And, um, wow&#8230;. here are my results, and in brackets the category they fall into

##### Extremely High

  * Casein (dairy)
  * Cottage cheese (dairy)
  * Cow&#8217;s milk (dairy)
  * Whey (dairy)
  * Yogurt (dairy)
  * Egg whites (meat)

##### Very high

  * Cheddar cheese (dairy)
  * Goat&#8217;s milk (dairy)
  * Banana (fruit) üôÅ üôÅ 
  * Cocoa bean (miscellany)

##### High

  * Chicken (meat)
  * Cod (seafood)
  * Sole (seafood)
  * Amaranth flour (nut/grain)
  * Kidney bean (nut/grain)
  * Pinto bean (nut/grain)
  * String bean (nut/grain)
  * Spelt (nut/grain)
  * Gluten (nut/grain)
  * Whole wheat (nut/grain)

The vegetable column of the chart had no glaring red notes showing a high response &#8211; the worst was my suspected potato, which was marked &#8220;moderate&#8221;. (and any follower of the paleo diet will tell you that&#8217;s not a real vegetable, it&#8217;s a tuber, and shouldn&#8217;t be eaten&#8230;.) In contrast, everything in the dairy column was extremely high or very high except mozzarella, which was marked moderate. 

Fruits were also really good, except for that sad &#8220;extremely high&#8221; banana rating. Too bad I eat bananas pretty well every day&#8230; 

There is lots in the nut/grain column I&#8217;m ok with, although down at the bottom is a clustering of high sensitivity to gluten, spelt and whole wheat. Over the past 6 weeks or so I&#8217;d already started cutting back on my grain intake, just not having so many sandwiches, etc. We certainly hear a lot of gluten-free food options these days, to the point where it is almost a fad. If you don&#8217;t have that sensitivity though, it&#8217;s overkil to avoid gluten. So I was glad to get some sort of indication that it&#8217;s something worth the effort for me. The recommendation is to remove everything rated &#8220;extremely high/very high/high&#8221; from your diet.

#### My body wants me to be paleo?

What&#8217;s the paleo diet? Meat, vegetables, nuts and seeds. No dairy, no grains. Hrmmm.. personally, I&#8217;m not interested in incorporating meat into my diet, so I&#8217;ll just have to focus on other ways to get my protein. 

When I started eating clean, I actually increased my intake of cottage cheese, yogurt and eggs. Apparently, I should return to what I was doing naturally on my own and avoid that stuff. Which I suppose is why I wanted to take this test: to figure out if following a generic food plan truly was the best thing for me&#8230;
