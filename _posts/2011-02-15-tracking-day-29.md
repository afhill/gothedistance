I did my PT exercises this morning, then went to PT. Afterwork I went to bootcamp. Today&#8217;s workout wasn&#8217;t super: half of it was shadowboxing. :-/ Then I went for a deep tissue massage &#8211; wow! She spent a fair amount of time on my back (rather than my legs, which was what I initially thought I really needed), but afterwards I felt like jello &#8211; warm, contented, jello. 

Wow &#8211; day 29. The other day Frida asked me how long I was going to keep tracking, and I said I wasn&#8217;t sure. Honestly, when I started it was totally on a whim, just to see if I&#8217;d keep up with it. After all, it wasn&#8217;t like I was explicitly following any sort of plan. Now, I&#8217;ve found I really like the habit. However, I feel like over the past week or so, I&#8217;ve become a little more lax on it: making banana bread and eating cheese and chocolate. I also eat all the time &#8211; not even like 5-6 meals a day, just constant grazing. Part of what I&#8217;ve read about Eating Clean says to combine a complex carb with a lean protein at every meal. I&#8217;m not, because I just grab individual items all..day. You&#8217;d think I didn&#8217;t know when my next nutrients were coming! 

The ole marathoner in me comes out, knowing that I always do better with a plan. So.. I&#8217;m a few days out from Feb 21, which is my half-birthday, which I think may be a great day to set myself up with a formal goal. Meeting with the trainer on Thursday may help, but as I look at the amazing progress Frida and Queen made during their program, I really feel like I&#8217;d like to see what I can do with some more focused effort. So.. the rules are being written..
