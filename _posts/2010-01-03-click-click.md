My knee has started clicking again. Sure, possibly related to the fact I&#8217;ve run more training miles in the past week than I have since the Spring?? I feel good though: my knee isn&#8217;t sore while I run, it just makes noise.

I found some great stretches to do in the latest edition of Advanced Marathoning, so I&#8217;m going to try to be really careful about stretching properly. I feel strong and motivated right now, and I don&#8217;t want that to get derailed!
