To complement my New Years Resolution of running every day, I am going to start being better about tracking my mileage. Yes, I have my garmin keeping track of everything, but I miss the look of a calendar chock-full of daily runs. I think it&#8217;s neat to see how the mileage ebbs and flows over the year. 

So here goes: <http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pgx4qM2eRki4TlC-_e4XeJA>  
It doesn&#8217;t capture any more info on how the run went, the conditions, how I felt. but at least I&#8217;ll be able to see how my dedication is (and keep track of monthly mileage relatively easily)
