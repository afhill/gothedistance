Spring hit Ohio today. It was absolutely gorgeous! Sadly, I only got in a 3.5 mile run. Some friends had decided to go watch the [Ohio Roller Girls](ohiorollergirls.com/), and were driving together. Rather than drive the half mile to a friends&#8217; place, I jumped on my bike.

This may not have been the most prudent decision, for a few reasons:

  1. I was wearing shoes with heels
  2. I was wearing LONG jeans
  3. I live in a historical district, with cobblestone streets
  4. I&#8217;m a runner. I like to face traffic when I&#8217;m on the road.

Despite these facts, it was great to be out on the bike. And once I hit her street (paved), I was able to step it up and really cruise. It felt great: I had a huge silly grin on my face. This is definitely going to be fun this summer!!
