I told myself I had to unplug this weekend to get some schoolwork done, but I&#8217;m sneaking on while dinner is on the stove- wanted to be sure to capture a good workout! 

We had a reasonably tough run planned &#8211; a total of 50 min hard, through a series of alternating pace sets. The forecast was for cold with crazy winds (28mph,), so I was steeling myself for a rough day. Thankfully the wind never transpired. 

Cheri was out of town so I lined up with Rick and Laura to start. We set out at my marathon pace, which felt downright easy (this hasn&#8217;t always been the case, even at workouts). After the first set the three of us started to spread out, with me between the two. I nudged the pace up a bit, ever keeping it in control and feeling pretty relaxed. I am actually really liking my Garmin 410 with its large lap pace display. After the third set or so Laura and I were running together, until we hit the long hill. Surprisingly, I felt strong headed up it and had to actually dial back my pace! Things felt good and then we wed at the next hill, where Jay was camped out taking photos. I&#8217;d been charging up the hill and he told me not to, just to concentrate on getting up it with even effort. His comment brought me back into my head, and I faltered a little as I started to over think and assess what I was doing. 

But unlike last week, when the hill crushed my spirit and basically caused me to give up on my workout, I was able to recover pretty well from the challenge. I actually found myself almost immediately dropping my pace significantly. Yay! We were supposed to pick it up the last three sets anyway, so I only pulled back a little. (6:17 back to 6:33 &#8211; I&#8217;d been closer to 7 before the hill). I crushed the next two sets, and my rest time was actually faster than our first interval had been! I felt good and strong! 

And then&#8230; Math got the best of me! I cruised towards Coot Lake and motored toward the Dam Wall! It was tough but I felt glad to be nearly done and seeing myself able to hold onto this great pace. There was a final uphill that hurt a bit, but then I hit my watch, happy to be done!  
Except&#8230; That wasn&#8217;t the last lap. I had already slowed to a walk, but sure enough, up ahead Rick was still running. Darn it&#8230; I tried to quickly recover and steel myself for one more lap, but my head was back distracting me from what I had to do. So my last lap was not what it should have been. I did pick it up for what I&#8217;d thought the last three laps were, and I know I could have executed well if not for my mistake. So overall, I&#8217;m considering it a pretty successful run. 

I know that I can do some work on those hills, learning how to approach them so as not to go into oxygen debt that&#8217;ll be tough to recover from. But in all I felt good about my paces and how I stuck to them. The run felt good as I kept increasing my pace (running smart) and I&#8217;m happy about my overall pace. Afterwards we did GSM and I used my new Roll R8 and I&#8217;m feeling pretty great!
