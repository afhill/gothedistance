Emailing with Bob yesterday, and he asked if I was doing the Pfitz plan for Boston. I said no, and he asked what plan I was doing, b/c he said he liked doing the same plan as we compared notes leading up to Steamtown. I told him no specific plan, just a long run, a medium-long run, a couple recovery runs and a speed/LT workout a week&#8230;. hmm&#8230;. which is basically the Pfitz plan. So now I&#8217;m going back and taking a look, basically the one thing I&#8217;d have to change from the Pfitz plan I used in the fall would be to change the recovery runs from Mondays (when I&#8217;m busy) to Sunday. Well that&#8217;s not such a big deal. And, the plan did work well for me, and it was good to have specific workouts set out for me. So yeah, I&#8217;m going to go back and look at it for Boston. I will have to make some changes based on intermediate races I&#8217;ll be doing, but otherwise, I might as well!
