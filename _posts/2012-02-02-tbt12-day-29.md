Grrrr&#8230; I&#8217;d just finished my post, including stating that I was writing on my phone bc my Internet is acting up, and it got deleted.

Anyway&#8230; So I KNEW I&#8217;d get hurt at Crossfit. I spent all night alternating an ice pack and a heating pad on my back. However, I did wake up feeling absolutely giddy because I&#8217;d dreamt about running an ultra. It was as though I felt honored to have had this dream. Huh?

&#8211; two bowls of Ezekiel cereal with kefir, blueberries, hemp seed  
&#8211; tea with ginger and turmeric (natural anti-inflammatories)  
&#8211; ProBar  
&#8211; whole wheat pita with hummus, falafel, veggie salad, eggplant (at garbanzos)  
&#8211; a few raisins  
&#8211; pear  
&#8211; quorn chikn niblets with black beans, tomato, onion, lime, spices in a whole wheat tortilla  
&#8211; monster aminos  
&#8211; carrot, apple, ginger juice. So pretty! 

**Recovery**  
Since I hadn&#8217;t been all week, I went to AllSports after work. Did the boots, inversion table and rumble roller. Also got a massage from Maria. I was a bit worried it would further aggravate my back, but she did a great job and helped a lot!

**Exercise**  
Went to the gym on my way home from Boulder, but I was NOT feeling it. Plus, I didn&#8217;t know what to work on! Did some incline bench work ( dumbbell chest press, flys, bicep curls) but nothing too impressive. So we&#8217;ll call this one a rest day.
