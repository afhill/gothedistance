Today I had a 20 miler on the schedule. So, I&#8217;ve been congested since Tuesday and hurt my back Thursday.. I still wanted to get this run in, but I woke this morning and knew it wasn&#8217;t prudent. But I&#8217;m also sick of being sick so I took solace in mucinex and a FLECTOR patch today. No more joking around! But just the fact that I slept a good 9-10 hours and still woke up terribly congested and feeling icky was a pretty good sign that 20 miles wasn&#8217;t smart. 

This is no good! I absolutely need to be getting my long runs in. I think the problem is that my speedwork is very structured and I have focus while I&#8217;m doing them. I love trail running just for the sake of running. But then there are these weekly lonely long runs.. I got into running for the social aspect and long runs never felt long when I was in Columbus. I nearly always had someone to chat away with as we covered the miles. I really really miss that here. I&#8217;m hoping to remedy that soon. 

Not running for most of the week has left me a bit antsy and after wandering the [Chatfield Corn Maze](http://www.botanicgardens.org/content/corn-maze) on a gorgeous afternoon, I wanted to run even more. So, I decided to go for an easy fun run. I headed out to Deer Canyon (yes, right by the Corn maze, but I&#8217;d already been thinking about Deer Canyon in the morning before I knew where the maze was) and did a nice run. I just so adore trail running! Even when it&#8217;s hard and you&#8217;re breathing like mad, it feels like a sign of respect, not failure. 

Although I&#8217;ve been enjoying seeing myself get more speedy this year and I&#8217;m curious how much my road running could improve, there is just something so satisfying about hitting the trails..
