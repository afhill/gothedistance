Well I continued my tradition of buying a book at the Columbus expo. I picked up &#8220;From Fairbanks to Boston &#8211; 5 Great US Marathons.&#8221; Columbus and Boston are in there, so it&#8217;ll be neat to read about those, as well as pick up some ideas of other races, I&#8217;m sure.. 

My plan for tomorrow is simply to beat 3:57:42. I really hope I don&#8217;t push myself too hard, I can definitely see that happening. I just want to take it easy and not push myself. I guess the first few miles will let me know how it&#8217;s going.
