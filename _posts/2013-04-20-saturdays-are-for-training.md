So I&#8217;m on a Facebook fast until I&#8217;m through finals next week, but I didn&#8217;t say no blogging, so I guess this is going to be my outlet. (total loophole)

I struggle a bit on Saturdays. I can generally keep up with Rick, Laura and Cheri on Tuesdays, and our easy runs are all together, but Saturdays I lag behind. A few weeks ago I gave up my ego and just decided to use Saturdays for my own training, and it&#8217;s definitely improved my mood. I don&#8217;t worry about how others do, just focus on running the workout as best I can. 

Today was a doozy &#8211; a mile warmup, then skipping, then 4 miles steady. A 1 min break, then 5 miles with 1 mile fast, 1 mile steady). 

I should also probably admit that the course elevation went up the first half&#8230;

I didn&#8217;t let myself get tempted into trying to keep up with Rick and Laura &#8211; they took off right away and I just chugged along at a decent but not killer pace. I wanted to be sure I&#8217;d be feeling good for the second half.

1: 7:43  
2. 7:47  
3. 7:42  
4. 7:35  
&#8212;  
5. 6:30  
6. 7:02  
7. 6:34  
8. 7:01  
9. 6:26

With a warmup and cooldown I ended up with 12.15 miles in 1:33:11 (7:40 pace overall). 

My goal for the speedy miles had been 6:30 &#8211; 6:45, and I was surprised that even in the steady &#8216;off&#8217; miles I&#8217;d glance at my watch and see I was running around 6:40. 

The fast miles weren&#8217;t easy, but I wasn&#8217;t dying (until the last half mile or so). Most importantly, I felt like I had good form! When I hit the last mile, I actually felt myself loosen up and I felt strong. What was funny is that immediately after we finished I felt my form collapse, but as long as I can hold it together when it counts, I&#8217;m happy with that! I do think that improving my stride and efficiency has got to be the biggest benefit from my upping my miles and I&#8221;m excited to see how it plays out. 

Two weeks til the Colorado Half!
