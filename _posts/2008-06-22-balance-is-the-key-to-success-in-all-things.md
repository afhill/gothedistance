I recently came across a quote that I&#8217;d recorded at some point:

> &#8220;Balance is the key to success in all things. Do not neglect your mind, body or spirit. Invest time and energy in all of them equally &mdash; it will be the best investment you ever make, not just for your life but for whatever is to follow.&#8221; &#8211; Tanya Wheway

It&#8217;s amazing how easily I forget it. Even though I have been running something every day, I haven&#8217;t derived the same enjoyment from as it as I sometimes do. A sure sign of that has been my desire to run with an iPod. For the longest time I didn&#8217;t even have an mp3 player, it was never part of my running routine. But I started using it for some long runs over the winter, and recently have turned to it as a crutch for my long runs. It&#8217;s been even worse since I haven&#8217;t been making it out to my group&#8217;s long runs on the weekends.. my mileage has suffered along with my motivation.

Well thankfully today I made it out for a bike ride with [Melissa](http://itsamonkey.blogspot.com), and wow, everything feels so much better now. I feel envigorated and energized and gung ho! To some extent, it&#8217;s what [Mike Krotscheck](http://krotscheck.net) and I were talking about the other day &#8211; sometimes you&#8217;re just in a rut &#8211; you can even recognize it, but there you are. I was running, but I was using crutches to go through the motions. I wasn&#8217;t fully engaged and it wasn&#8217;t &#8216;easy&#8217; or &#8216;fun&#8217;. 

Generally Melissa and I ride 20 miles. (As in, I&#8217;ve never run further than that). Today at the turn around point, I suggested we keep going. So we did 30. I came home, changed, grabbed some gu and headed out for a run. I was feeling strong, happy, energetic and stable. I spend a lot of time in my own head, and I can get really anxious and bothered by things. When I have a good workout like today, I feel like things are in their proper perspective. 

In a world where we&#8217;re so busy and have so much to achieve and accomplish, I love the fact that I just spent 4 hours (17% of the day!) outside, sweating. I wasn&#8217;t coding, or gardening, or doing laundry. I was thinking and feeding myself emotionally, physically and to some extent spiritually.  
And it&#8217;s going to make everything else I do today so much better&#8230;.
