#### Food

  * smoothie: egg whites, kefir, mustard greens, carrots, banana, orange, grapefruit, protein powder, chia seeds, wheat germ, flax seeds, frozen fruit
  * tea
  * trail mix
  * starbucks unsweetened nf Earl grey latte 
  * sugar snap peas, dry rye toast, salad (spring mix, tomato, cucumber, hemp seed, hard-boiled egg, lite raspberry vinaigrette
  * ice cream. JUST KIDDING! despite the fact an ice cream truck literally parked beneath my window at work and played its siren&#8217;s song, I was good. Honestly? I didn&#8217;t even feel tempted at all. That cake in the fridge though keeps calling my name.. And causing me to realize I don&#8217;t have a cheat day planned for this week. Guess I could have cheated more last Saturday! 
  * Indian veggie combo: saag paneer (I read this is cottage cheese so I consider it ok), naan (which I thought was ok but frida just posted today that she avoided it herself), chickpeas, eggplant, lentils, coconut shrimp curry. Chai. 

#### Exercise

  * 5 mile run-felt good!

My run was great, though between yesterday&#8217;s killer calf workout and today&#8217;s run, my calves were on fire today! I even wore compression socks, and they were tender to the touch. I love feeling the burn! My parents came to town and we walked to dinner, including up some stairs over a footbridge, and yowza!
