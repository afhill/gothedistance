It&#8217;s official, I am a cold weather runner.

The forecast was for cold, rain, wind, even snow. I wore a long-sleeved shirt, shorts, a new coolmax hat AND SMARTWOOL SOCKS. I covered up with another long sleeved shirt and wrapped a garbage bag around my legs. 

I was officially the last person out of the porta-potties before turning into the corral. I was in the same corral as Doug and his son Chris, but Chris was getting a little nervous so they headed into the corral. I met up with them right before the start. I noticed there was a 3:30 pace group in front of us, and as the Pref II corral moved up closer behind us, a 3:30 pace group behind us. As we approached the start line, I told Doug &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to try to hang with them.&#8221; And I was off!

Mile 1/2: 15:48 (7:54)  
Dropped my shirt in the first mile, kept my makeshift skirt. I&#8217;d forgotten to take my pre-race GU, so I took it at the water stop around the second mile. Whoops, that&#8217;s definitely not an 8:30 pace!

Mile 3: 8:05  
A little better&#8230; I realize I&#8217;m a bit ahead of the pace group, so I slow down dramatically (I think frustrating some other runners in the process)

Mile 4:7:44  
Mile 5:7:41 

I glare over at the pace group leaders much like I often glare at Doug. 3:30 is an 8:01 pace, NOT a 7:4x pace!!! Try to force myself to slow down. My knee actually started to hurt a little, so at the next waterstop I had a couple advil.

Mile 6: 8:09  
Mile 7: 7:53

I realize that I can&#8217;t be too angry with the pace group leaders for going too fast when I&#8217;m ahead of them. I try to force myself to slow.

Mile 8: 7:55  
Mile 9: 8:03

I think it was about this point that I realize I may as well ditch my garbage bag skirt. I&#8217;m trying to stay well-hydrated and well-fueled. Whereas in past races I&#8217;ve stopped at water stops, I run through them and find things are just fine.

Mile 10: 8:00

Perfect!

Mile 11: 7:58  
Mile 12: 8:08

Mile 13.1: 8:52 (half: 1:44:21)

I realize that that&#8217;s a good half time. I&#8217;m feeling strong, but I&#8217;m separated from the pace group again. I look around, and someone asks me, &#8220;Are you looking forthe 3:30 pace group?&#8221;  
I respond, &#8220;yes, I think one is behind me&#8221;.  
&#8220;They both are&#8221;.  
&#8220;Oh! Well I&#8217;m going to slow down to meet them, then! Have a great race.&#8221; And I forced myself to let them catch me.

Mile 14 (only .9): ~7:26  
Mile 15: 7:58  
Mile 16: 8:05

By this point the miles were ticking off. I tend to say that the race begins at 16, and I was feeling strong!

Mile 17: 8:02 

I think it was this mile where I had to stop to pick a stone out of the bottom of my shoe. It was a bit of a princess and the pea situation, where it was a tiny tiny stone but I could feel it with every step. I watched both 3:30 pace groups pass me by. üôÅ  
Grabbed a powergel, they were pretty good!

Mile 18: 7:57  
Mile 19: 7:52

I was catching up to the group again, feeling good! 

Mile 20: 8:24

Stopped to walk and grab a piece of orange. NOT A GOOD IDEA! Took a couple bites, but there were seeds in it! Plus, the acid went right to my stomach. Not a choice I&#8217;ll make again. Thinking back, I also stopped for a banana at about 15 or so, just grabbed a couple bites and walked a bit before continuing. Looking back at my time, I can&#8217;t tell when I took that stop..

Mile 21: 7:50  
Mile 22: 7:56  
Mile 23: 7:57

These last miles were ticking away. I wasn&#8217;t feeling great, I was struggling to keep up with the 3:30 pace group, but I knew my pace was ok.

Mile 24: 8:04  
Mile 25: 8:11

The pace group leader was telling people to pick it up but I was going to wait for a bit longer. 

Mile 25.2: 1:44

I decided to hit my watch to record the final mile as separate. The last mile or mile and a half was rough, there was a bit of a jog to the left and right, including a bit of an uphill. As I made that turn, I found myself having trouble getting started again. I actually stopped a moment to walk before heading off to finish what I knew was going to be a PR race.

At mile 26 I looked at my watch, 3:28:15. Inside, I groaned. Bridget had predicted 3:28:14 for my marathon time. Ah, if only the race were an even 26!

I felt myself picking it up for the final stretch. It was ridiculous how crowded it was, however. I couldn&#8217;t pick up as much as I may have liked, but I knew I&#8217;d be happy with my finish.

Final mile: 7:49

Final time: 3:29:41

&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;  
First half: 1:44:21  
Second half: 1:45:21

I&#8217;m sore tonight, but that&#8217;s a good thing! Today was a great marathon day. I realized it last night as I crawled into bed, my clothes set out beside me, the marathon toaster waiting to serve. There are traditions that just put me in the &#8216;marathon mindset&#8217; and helped me get so excited about today &#8211; definitely something to remember! I feel as though today was a run wherein I tried a few things that worked well for me. I carried pain killers and chapstick, stopped to eat a couple bites of banana, had several GUs, and overall just kept my head in the game!
