So I applied for the CKS the other day. On the race application it asked you how many CKSs you&#8217;d run before, and if you had never run one before, you were supposed to outline your running background. I got this email response today:

_Hi Andrea,  
We received your registration for CK50k Â and Â need to get more details on your training and running background. Please reply with a brief description of your training other than running 7 marathons. Your answer to Question 6 implies that this will be your first ultramarathon of any kind. If this is correct, then we would like to enocourage you to train  
properly for this event and if you have questions about the course or conditions to please use the yahoo group for this event. http://sports.groups.yahoo.com<wbr>/group/crownkingscramble/  
The race is an ultra event with steep climbs (5000 ft) and decents and long stretches without aid of any kind. The terrain is rocky, rutted and in most years you will get your feet wet._

Well this intimidated me a bit&#8230; I wrote to the RD I&#8217;d spoken with today, and got back this response.

  Background&#8230;Â 2 weeks ago,Â two ladies (law students&#8230; ; )(who have run multiple marathons and who areÂ  training for a marathon in Jan)Â &#8220;suffered injury&#8221;Â (aggravated a dormant herniated disk and suffered muscle soreness) and indicated they might sueÂ for injuries causes by RD negligence after runningÂ 22 milesÂ at a casual, no-fee run on aÂ portion of the course&#8230;Â they claimed, the race director (me) was negligent inÂ not adequately warningÂ runners of the rugged terrain&#8230; so, we&#8217;re being (&#8220;over&#8221;) cautious&#8230; weÂ updated the website and the entry form to ensure appropriate disclosure of the rugged terrain&#8230; &#8230;. Its all on &#8220;roads and 4X4 roads&#8221; but there are several steep hills and footing is unstableÂ in areas&#8230; </p> 
  
  <p>
    I feel runners can make responsible decisions as long as they know the course is difficult.. Laura assumes more of a parental role&#8230;Â <br /> Bottom line:Â  Your mileage is more than adequate&#8230; as long as you have some hill training,Â watch your step, run the downs gently,Â andÂ &#8220;hike&#8221;Â the majority of theÂ upsÂ (especially the steep ones),Â take timeÂ to rehydrate and refuel at aid stations, and enjoy the scenery and comraderie, you&#8217;ll have a very enjoyable day.<br /> &#8211; This is not equivalent to a long marathon&#8230; and can not be tackled as such&#8230; think of it asÂ a fast hike &#8230; 99% is runnable, but most runners will hike about 10-15%&#8230;</i>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So the RD&#8217;s response makes me feel better, but still&#8230; I wonder if this was the smartest course to try to tackle as a first ultra.

    (uh oh! If I tell that to Helen, she&#8217;ll probably encourage me to do one before that ðŸ˜‰ )
