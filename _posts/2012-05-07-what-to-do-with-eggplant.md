Last week I received an eggplant in my Door to Door Organics package. I&#8217;ve been doing stirfrys and curries, but I wanted to try something different. I was planning to look up eggplant recipes when I got home, when twitter came to the rescue!

I LOVE the Choosing Raw site, and here was exactly the main ingredient I needed! Although of course I had to make some significant modifications&#8230;

The real recipe: [Eggplant and Arugula Wraps with Tomato Basil Cashew Cheese](http://www.choosingraw.com/eggplant-and-arugula-wraps-with-tomato-basil-cashew-cheese/).

I knew I didn&#8217;t have any cashew cheese on hand and didn&#8217;t want to spend the several hours soaking the nuts, so I compromised and bought some Rice Shreds (mozzarella flavor). I tried them and was really impressed with the flavor&#8230; and then I turned over the package to find that there is casein in it. What the what?? üôÅ

I&#8217;m also not a big fan of sundried tomatoes, so I diced up a roma tomato with some olive oil, balsamic vinegar, minced garlic and basil (basically, bruscetta). 

And of course, no whole wheat tortilla for me, so my last modification was to use Nori to hold it all together!

My meal did NOT look at all like the pictures Gena posted, and the wraps were really hard to eat, but they were remarkably tasty! I ran out of nori sheets and ended up just having a plate of the eggplant, cheese, tomato, basil and arugula and it was still great; the different flavors complemented each other really nicely and the eggplant had a nice hearty feel to it.

I&#8217;d definitely consider buying eggplant JUST for this recipe again! (but next time I may give myself the prep time to make the cashew cheese)
