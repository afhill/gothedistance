Monday: NO RUNNING! I went to hot yoga for the first time in 6 weeks, which felt great. Before that I did hit the gym and did some chest work and a bit of abs. I need to work on getting my bench press back! It&#8217;s been a long time since I did free weights and I forgot how good it feels! (Also did a bunch of TRX atomic pushups)

Tuesday: [crossfit in the morning](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/04/crossfit-math-is-hard/), nearly did it as prescribed! It was heavy on the legs, with running, squats and deadlifts.

Wednesday: my legs were shot from the day before, but I still went to [crossfit in the morning](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/04/crossfit-wod-hero-jt/) for a killer Hero workout. At lunch I went to hot yoga to try to loosen up my hamstrings, and also did some foam rolling and lacrosse ball rolling for my glutes. Then in the evening I headed to the Runners Roost Run Club. I did 4 miles at a 7:34 pace wearing New Balance Minimus shoes. Kept me off my heels, but I ended up very close to blisters on my forefoot and toes.

Thursday: Crossfit included [snatches and double-unders](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/04/crossfit-snatches-and-double-unders/). Again &#8211; my poor calves!! (Also, no running)

Friday: Hit up Deer Creek Canyon for a 3.5 mile trail run, then stopped by the gym. Did a lot of arm and chest work. Bench press: 2x(20x45lbs), 10x55lbs, 5x65lbs, 16x45lbs, 2x70lbs. Can&#8217;t believe I did 23x80lbs 6 weeks ago&#8230; :-/

Saturday: Great workout with the RRBs &#8211; 9.1 miles in 1:16. My calves were sore at the outset but they didn&#8217;t seem to hold me back much

Sunday: Basically wrote off this week for good running, so only did an easy 5.26 at an 8:56 pace. Then in the evening I went down to Manitou Springs and we did the Incline at dusk and then came down Barr Trail in the dark. Gorgeous..

Total running miles: 24.61. Almost an embarrassment mileage-wise, but I still got in some great workouts.
