I had a long travel day today so I got up to hit the gym early. I forgot how great I feel working out in the morning! 

I&#8217;m also going to get back into BCAAing and creatining- though I forgot to pack any for my trip. 

#### Chest and tris

  * Dumbbell chest press 3x(5&#215;25, 30) left arm failed at 35
  * Dumbbell chest press 40x(20lbs)
  * Bench dips with feet on ball (3&#215;5)
  * Flyes 3x(5&#215;20)
  * Tricep rope pull down 3x(5&#215;30)
  * Incline bench 10&#215;12, 2x(5&#215;15)
  * Skullcrushers with one 35lb plate 3&#215;5
  * Incline flyes 3x(10&#215;12)
  * Tricep kick backs 3x(10&#215;12)
  * 10 decline pushups

And as of this evening, my legs are starting to feel DOMS. Nice!
