I&#8217;d heard about Orange Theory Fitness, as &#8220;that class where you wear a heart rate monitor and everyone in class can see how you&#8217;re doing&#8221;. For a competitive person like myself, I&#8217;ll admit I was somewhat intrigued. 

I have several friends who have started going and really enjoy the high intensity workouts, so when a groupon became available, I decided to try it out. This week I attended three classes and I&#8217;ve got to say, I really enjoy it!

*Disclaimer, I tend to like almost all fitness classes I attend.

The &#8220;theory&#8221; behind Orange Theory has to do with the aforementioned heart rate monitors. Your goal is to spend the majority of the workout in the orange zone, which is the fourth of five heart rate zones. This translates to about 85% of your max heart rate, which sadly I think they calculate based on your age. (Mine is higher than anything I&#8217;ve seen estimated). Regardless, the point of the work out is to WORK HARD! As they state on their website:

> During the 60-minute workout, you will perform multiple intervals designed to produce 12 to 20 minutes of training at 84% or higher of your maximum heart rate, which translates to Zones 4/5. This program design produces workout &#8220;afterburn&#8221; effect, which is an increased metabolic rate for 24 to 36 hours after the workout. When combing the amazing workout with EPOC, our clients burn an average of 500 to 1200 calories.

The workouts are a combination of rowing, running, and floor exercices like lifting, TRX and bodyweight exercises. 

And how is it? Geez&#8230; I leave the place absolutely dripping sweat, and can&#8217;t get through the plethora of pushups without having to take a break. The other morning I could barely put my jacket on after the workout, my shoulders and pecs were so exhausted. 

I&#8217;ve settled on doing running last in the set, and so far we&#8217;ve ranged from 3-11% incline on the treadmill. You do intervals of a few moments at different speeds and inclines, but there&#8217;s always a little teaser of &#8220;All Out&#8221; that my poor oxygen-deprived mind sets to around a 6mm (this is after 40 min of other stuff) and I run like a bat out of hell. I&#8217;m confident that if I weren&#8217;t already super exhausted, I would talk myself out of this ridiculousness. 

So OTF seems to focus a lot of their marketing on it being great for weight loss, which I don&#8217;t actually care about. but I can definitely tell you the ole metabolism is burning after, as I am STARVING all day after one of these workouts! I guess the trick is to be sure I&#8217;m eating well afterwards.. 

The great thing about these classes is that although your heart rate zones are up on the board for everyone to see, you&#8217;re really just competing against yourself. You go at your own pace and as veterans in the class state, it never gets easier you just get stronger/faster. I know I can definitely feel the effect it&#8217;s had on my fitness already, and it&#8217;s only week one!

All the locations around here give three free classes, so I&#8217;ve been suggesting to everyone that they give it a try. Unlike Crossfit, you&#8217;re unlikely to do some crazy move unsafely and injure yourself. But like Crossfit, there&#8217;s some great accountability and comradery to help encourage you to push yourself harder than you would on your own.
