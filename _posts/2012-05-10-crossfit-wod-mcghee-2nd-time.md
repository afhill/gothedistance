Today we did the McGhee Hero workout. I did this as one of my first workouts back in [February](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/02/crossfit-wod-mcghee/) so I was excited to see how I did this time. 

> McGhee:  
> AMRAP 30 minutes
> 
>   * 5 deadlifts
>   * 13 pushups
>   * 9 box jumps

Leo said to go with 75% of your one-rep max, but I wanted to do the same weight as last time to compare. For some reason I was thinking my 1RM was 155, so 116# would be about right. However, Loren reminded me afterwards that our 1RM was actually higher than that. Oh well..

I was confident I&#8217;d do better this time. Last time I struggled with the lifts and got some instruction mid-way through, had to wait to share a box with someone, and failed a few times on the pushups. 

Today I executed everything SO much better! The deadlifts were relatively easy (\*ahem\* funny how that happens when the weight is lighter than it &#8220;should&#8221; be), I approached the pushups smart in breaking them up into sets and never going to failure, and I flew through the box jumps. I&#8217;d take a few seconds to rest between a few of the exercises but I never felt really tired. SO much different than last time!

At one point I grabbed water at the end of a rep and soon after was doubting I&#8217;d tracked that rep. Ugh&#8230; the guy next to me really struggled so I tried to gauge my reps by him. 

I was really amazed with how I was able to keep it going through the entire workout. Last time I definitely faltered near the end, I remember trying for a single pushup at a time and failing. I flew through these. There were 35 seconds left when I started my last set. I got through the deadlifts and started the pushups and powered through 9 before we got the sign to stop. 

I looked at my numbers: 15+14, or 16+14? Given the fact that in February I did 14 with the breaks and I knew I&#8217;d been much steadier, I felt like it was probably 16. Then (bad Andrea) I saw some of the other numbers people were putting up and felt that 16 was even more likely. There is one older woman in the class and I saw her resting a lot, and she posted 16. I know it&#8217;s not about competition but I felt like I was pretty consistent through the workout. I just wish I knew for sure! 

Loren continued to impress as it turns out she was doing 135# in the deadlift! Whoa! She actually didn&#8217;t even know; Leo had told her to grab certain weights and she loaded up without doing the math. I&#8217;m glad she didn&#8217;t because I think mentally that would have held her back. She&#8217;s super strong, but I think her head gets in the way! But she only posted 14 rounds and I&#8217;m not sure I did over 2 rounds more than her. Hmmm..

Today was my last day on my pass but I think I&#8217;m going to pay for a few more workouts until I move to Boulder. I really like the box and going with Loren. I&#8217;ll miss it when I move! 

Even being conservative with 15+14, that means I deadlifted my body weight 80 times, did 224 pushups (the workout plus warmup), and did 135 box jumps. Whoa&#8230;
