So I&#8217;m back on the TBT bandwagon again, and today someone [posted on the Facebook wall](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/90dayTBT/posts/317406788299652):

> Can I ask what is the concept behind the cheat day? Is it just a day to rest your mind about what it is you can and cannot eat or is there more to it than that? After I cheat I feel disgusting.

First off, I think that her last sentence sums it up! When I first started eating clean, I&#8217;d look forward to those cheat days, stockpile some chocolate and eagerly look forward to my treats. And then I&#8217;d have them, and think it wasn&#8217;t worth it. Often the day after, I&#8217;d feel a little ill. Letting yourself have those &#8220;reminders&#8221; keeps you from fixating on what you&#8217;re missing out on. 

Also, eating clean is intended to be &#8220;a lifestyle&#8221;, not &#8220;a diet&#8221;. That is, it&#8217;s something you can conceivably do forever. Yet there are probably very few people in the world who will never want to have any &#8220;unclean&#8221; food. By building in those cheat days, you are still living within the program even when special occasions arise. I believe the actual Eat Clean program only builds in a couple cheat meals, though, it&#8217;s not really intended to be 24 hours of gluttony. 

I think the idea of allowing for some treats is encouraging: if you go out with friends or want to enjoy something special, you can do so without feeling guilty or thinking you&#8217;ve failed at the program. After all, this is not a short-term diet, it&#8217;s simply a healthier way to fuel yourself, and in the grand scheme of things, having 104 cheat meals out of nearly 1000 a year is a heck of a lot better than the yo-yo dieting that too many people go through. 

As for the idea of a single cheat &#8220;day&#8221; rather than splitting up multiple treats over the week &#8211; I think that this helps you with self-control. If I knew I had a special event coming up, I would plan for that day to be my cheat day. I&#8217;d simply make healthy choices the other days, and that helped with recognizing that treats are treats. If you let yourself eat something crappy every day, are you really exhibiting any discipline? 

There are probably some metabolic implications too but I&#8217;m not going to do that research today ðŸ™‚

So that&#8217;s my take on cheating. For most of 2011 even after I was officially off the TBT, I continued to eat healthily most days, because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d programmed myself to do. I remembered how it felt when I&#8217;d wait 5 days to have a piece of chocolate, only to realize it didn&#8217;t taste as good as I had anticipated. It was thoughtful, and I believe it&#8217;s a smarter, more sustainable way to eat.
