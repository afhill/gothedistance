Food  
-Breakfast burrito: eggs, potatoes, veggies, guac, salsa on a whole wheat tortilla  
&#8211; Bhakti chai/coffee blend  
&#8211; orange  
&#8211; banana  
&#8211; fresh tomato pizza with ricotta  
&#8211; beer  
&#8211; salmon/mango roll  
&#8211; sesame tofu with brown rice

Exercise  
-1.75 mile run

I decided to skip out on the Longmont run in favor of a less-rushed morning. I had a good breakfast and de-stressed a bit. The tournament still made eating hard, and again I drank just bc it was a special occasion. The sushi roll and pizza weren&#8217;t great, but they definitely could have been worse!
