Yesterday and today I&#8217;ve been out riding, with my beloved garmin. However, I&#8217;m not too excited about having to turn my wrist everytime I want to monitor how I&#8217;m doing (and as a new cyclist, I&#8217;m still in that &#8220;how fast am I going now? how about now?&#8221; stage). So naturally, a bike mount seems to be in order!  
I dd a quick google search, and found a few product listings. Radio Shack actually had something for $7, but then there were two listing on the official garmin site:  
The [Quick Release Bike Replacement](http://www.provantage.com/garmin-010-10889-01~7GRMN07W.htm) and the [Quick Release Kit](http://www.provantage.com/garmin-010-10889-00~7GRMN07V.htm). Now logic would say I need the full kit because I&#8217;m not actually replacing anything (other than my wrist), but it&#8217;s not clear to be what extra the kit offers that I need.  
I decided to do some more mining online, and read a reference on Bruce Morgan&#8217;s blog about a [DIY aerobar mount](http://brucemorgan.blogs.com/afc/2007/03/garmin_forerunn.html). I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;d just as soon pay for the official garmin product, but I still haven&#8217;t quite determined which I need. Right now I&#8217;m not really concerned about the &#8220;quick&#8221; aspect of the release, although I suppose that could change if this whole duathlon thing pans out..

**Update:** and of course, a bit more digging brings me to the [garmin cadence sensor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BFNOT8/ref=pd_cp_e_2?pf_rd_p=250314601&pf_rd_s=center-41&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B0000CFYMI&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=01Z8N6WMESMFY32T2P9W) that is compatible with the Forerunner 305. It&#8217;s actually cheaper than I expected. Ahhh, more toys!
