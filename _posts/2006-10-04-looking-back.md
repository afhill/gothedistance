I haven&#8217;t felt like I had the greatest training period this summer, so I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out my goal for Chicago. I decided to look back on my training log from last year, and I found some interesting things:

http://runlikeagrrl.livejournal.com/13284.html &#8211; I already commented [hee](http://runlikeagrrl.livejournal.com/54205.html) on doing 19.5 at Antrim like last year, and bettering my time.

http://runlikeagrrl.livejournal.com/14776.html &#8211; Ran 17 at Antrim, wanted to do the latter part at MP + 10%, or 8:48. Ended up being an overall pace of 8:33 &#8212; which is almost exactly the pace I ran at the HomeStretch 20 Miler two weeks ago.

http://runlikeagrrl.livejournal.com/16320.html &#8211; the same track workout I did on Monday with Mike and Meredith: 8mi w/ 5&#215;600 @ 5K pace. I was faster Monday than last year.

So who knows how Chicago will go? .. ðŸ™‚
