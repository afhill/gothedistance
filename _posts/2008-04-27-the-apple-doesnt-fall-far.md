This morning, my Mom went for her last long run before the [Flying Pig Half](http://www.flyingpigmarathon.com/race_information/schedule/half.shtml) next weekend. It was so nice out, she was thinking about breaking out her bike and going riding when she got home. Before doing so, she checked my blog, only to find that her only daughter had biked and run today as well! 

We were chatting on the phone a little while ago, and she told me that she&#8217;d decided to take a break from running (she ran the [ING Edmonton Half Marathon](http://www.events.runningroom.com/site/?raceId=2491&eventId=12120&vrindex=4) in August, and the [New Las Vegas Half](http://running.zappos.com/n/mr?show_results=1&participant_id=9930) in December). And then she told me she was thinking about doing a full next year!

&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I noted, &#8220;so that&#8217;ll be for the big birthday?&#8221; She hadn&#8217;t even been thinking that she turns 60 in &#8217;09. And her birthday is in Marathon Month (October)! She said she&#8217;d heard great things about [Victoria](http://www.royalvictoriamarathon.com/), so perhaps that will be it&#8230;
