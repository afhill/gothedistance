Today I ran a nice long 18 miler with Meredith. When we met, she had two water bottles, a fuel belt and multiple powergels with her. She was ready for a long run! She&#8217;s still working with her coach, and I&#8217;m always interested to see what she has planned. Today was 18 miles below zone 2 ( a 161 heart rate for her). I just wanted to get the miles in, so we set off. 

It was a bit chilly this morning, which was perfect. We chatted away, as you&#8217;re wont to do while you run for miles and miles&#8230; as well, with the heart rate monitor keeping us &#8216;easy&#8217;, we were able to keep talking the whole way ðŸ™‚

I&#8217;ll admit that my knee started to get a bit sore around 15, but we stopped then for refueling and chatted with Nils and Aisha, and once we started again (and I got over that stiffness that happens when you stop to chat for 10 min in the middle of a run), it felt ok. 

It was in the last mile or so that Meredith mentioned that she would miss me. Well, actually I believe she said &#8220;who am I going to be competitive with now? I got a coach, and now you&#8217;re moving to altitude!&#8221; (she&#8217;s so sweet&#8230;) It&#8217;s true, though. I&#8217;ve run with Meredith for 4 years now. We&#8217;ve been through hundreds of miles together, and even if we don&#8217;t see each other for months, we fall right back in stride and I love our runs together. After we parted ways after our run (18 miles in 2:52:04, which is a perfectly acceptable 9:33 pace, particularly with an average HR of 153 [that&#8217;s recovery run pace]), I felt that supreme contentment and satisfaction I have after a good long run. I am so thankful to have running, and such great friends to share it with. Sure, we can keep in touch via email, we&#8217;ll meet up in at least Boston every year, but really, it&#8217;s those long training runs that really mean something. 

Boo hoo hoo, I have to move to the runner&#8217;s mecca, Colorado. But I will certainly to miss some of the things that made me love running: my friends.
