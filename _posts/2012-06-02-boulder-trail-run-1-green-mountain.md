I&#8217;ve been a Boulder resident 48 hours, so of course I&#8217;ve already done a trail run!

This morning I got up and headed out to Green Mountain. The trailhead is quite close to my new place, which is an absolute thrill! Even without setting an alarm last night, I was parked and ready to run by 6:30am.

I&#8217;d selected Green Mountain not only for its proximity, but because I&#8217;d read it was challenging due to some [good elevation gain](http://www.runcolo.com/content/running-green-mountain-boulder-285/). I decided to give my new [Hoka One Ones](http://hokaoneone-na.com/stinson-detail-women.html) a try. I brought along water, my phone for photos, and gu. 

And.. whoa. 

I was glad I brought along my phone for a few reasons: it was gorgeous and worthy of documenting, but it also gave me an excuse to stop along the way.

I kept thinking about how technical it was compared to Pikes Peak or Lookout Mountain. 

One of my running buddies is doing Pikes Peak and he said he&#8217;s been running Green Mountain to get ready. From a technical standpoint, I think he&#8217;ll be fine! I&#8217;d say this was definitely more challenging to run.

    Yes - the path here goes UP

I will admit as I climbed, I started to get more anxious about the Leadville marathon coming up in a month. If I was walking here, what was 11,000ft of elevation going to do to me?? I did gain a greater appreciation for why ultra/trail runners track their runs by elevation gain rather than miles. 

What&#8217;s that about ultra runners? Oh yeah &#8211; I totally tried to convince myself that if [Anton Krupicka](http://antonkrupicka.blogspot.com/) runs this danged trail several times a week, it MUST be a good challenge!! 

I walked a fair amount today, but I told myself that any altitude was good, and I really wanted to work on my downhill running. I didn&#8217;t see anyone on the trails until I made it up to the summit, where there were a half-dozen people milling about.

After a few minutes I headed back down, which was fun! I hadn&#8217;t been sure about the new shoes thus far, but I really liked the grippiness and cushion as I headed down the trail. I felt comfortable heading down the trail and I actually found I ran much more &#8220;naturally&#8221; without being so afraid of landing too heavily. 

Eventually though, possibly due to fatigue, I must have gotten a bit sloppy. Easing my way down some somewhat sheer rock I slipped a bit and put my hands down on the rock. No big deal. But only a few steps later my left ankle twisted a bit. I started off again and told myself to &#8220;loosen up, calm down&#8221;. And then my RIGHT ankle seemed to slip. What the? I stopped to truly get settled again. I wanted to fly, but I&#8217;d become clumsy in the space of 5 minutes. 

I started off again, enjoying the views but not needing to stop to catch my breath on my way down. There were plenty of hikers on the trails now, in stark contrast to when I was ascending.

Then with only a half mile to go, my left ankle REALLY gave out. I pitched to the ground. UGH!! I feel like I should be used to this now &#8211; pretty well every trail run ends with me with a sore left ankle. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I have to like it. I walked the last little bit to the trailhead, then jogged back to the car. Back on solid ground again my ankle felt decent, but I hate how it affects me mentally. How am I going to learn to be an aggressive downhill runner if I keep having these little episodes? Sure, it was nothing serious but it doesn&#8217;t do me any good to have to slow and &#8220;check myself&#8221; to make SURE I&#8217;m ok! 

The run was gorgeous, although it was a definite challenge. It made me a bit anxious about Leadville, but there&#8217;s not too much I can do about that other than try to make the time to get ready in the next month. 

I came home and was SO glad I&#8217;d brought my camera to have these photos. I plugged in my garmin and also felt a bit better once I saw the crazy course profile. Of COURSE it was hard.. this is definitely a mountain!!!

I still can&#8217;t believe this is only a few minutes from home&#8230; I feel so fortunate to be able to have moved here!!
