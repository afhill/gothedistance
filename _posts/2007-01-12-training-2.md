I still need to make up an official plan for training, but in the meantime:

next week&#8217;s key workouts:

long run 2: 12  
long run 1: 8  
LT workout: 8mile run with long hills or three mile tempo run  
V02 Max: none  
Basic speed: 10&#215;100 metres  
(weekly mileage: 39)

I am not worried about the overall mileage at this point.  
Next Saturday I have plans so I won&#8217;t be able to meet everyone for the long run, I&#8217;ll have to fit it in elsewhere&#8230; perhaps

Mon: 12?  
Tues: 8 with Meredith?  
Wed:  
Thurs: speed at the gym  
Fri: 8 with Helen?  
Sat:  
Sun:
