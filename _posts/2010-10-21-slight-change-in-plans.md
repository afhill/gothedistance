Two days before the race, we had two runner substitutions. To try to keep the two teams competitive, the captain asked if I&#8217;d switch legs (and vans). I jumped at the chance! I now have the most difficult-ranked legs of the course but I&#8217;m in a van with the folks I know the best! Looking forward to it!  
One of my fave running buddies isn&#8217;t coming with us, but I stayed with her tonight and we did 4.5 miles on the bike trail. It was great to catch up with her! She&#8217;s recovering from injury, otherwise I feel we could have convinced her to run. She&#8217;s already eyeing a relay for next year!
