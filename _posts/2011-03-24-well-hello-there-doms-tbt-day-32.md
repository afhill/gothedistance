(That&#8217;s [delayed onset muscle soreness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness) for the blissfully unaware)

I had great intentions to go to spinning this morning, but my legs are still sore from my [leg workout Tuesday](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/03/tbt-day-30/)! I&#8217;d read an article about doing drop-sets during leg extensions and so I&#8217;d tried that, and did some huge weight with the leg press, not sure which is the main cause for what I&#8217;m feeling right now? Either way, I decided not to push it since I&#8217;d also planned to hit up hot yoga tonight&#8230; Nothing wrong with actually letting my knee rest, right? :-/

#### Food

  * 7:15 protein pancakes with pb. Kiwi
  * 9:45 Ezekiel cereal with kefir and hemp seed
  * 11:45 dates
  * 12:00 salad-spring mix, tomato, cucumber, hemp seed, pumpkin seeds. funny, before the TBT I would have let a salad be all veggies, but now I&#8217;m conscious to be sure I&#8217;m eating protein with!
  * 2:00 the ninja came to work today, so I made smoothies for Mallory and I: kefir, egg whites, cucumber, kale, hemp seed, banana, orange, and random frozen fruit. She said it tastes&#8230;. &#8220;healthy&#8221;.
  * 3:00 banana, hemp seed and pb in a whole wheat tortilla
  * 4:15 almonds
  * 4:45 light tuna and lentil chips. Apple
  * 8:00 apple. They have free fruit at the fancy-pants gym!
  * 9:00 brown rice with spinach, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, peas, bean sprouts

  * 1.5hr [thermal yoga](http://www.puravidaclub.com/yoga_class_descriptions.html) at my fancy-pants new gym

Today I posted my 30day back picture on Facebook, which garnered some interest in the TBT. A friend asked me for details and when I gave her the high-level nutritional guidelines, she asked if it was basically the raw diet. I don&#8217;t know a ton about the raw diet so I checked it out, and came across a great [Raw Food Diet Conversion Chart](http://www.thebestofrawfood.com/raw-food-diet-conversion-chart.html)!
