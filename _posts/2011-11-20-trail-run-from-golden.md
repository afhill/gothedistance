Yesterday on Twitter I saw [@cisforcourtney](http://twitter.com/cisforcourtney) mention she was doing 20 today. I responded and wrangled myself an invite to join the group. About a dozen of us met in Golden and headed up on a trail run. Yes, up..

The group would run for a bit, then reconvene, and start out again. We had some fun scrambling up some slippery trail and walking on a wall above the highway. In all, it looks like we did the Chimney Gulch trail up to [Windy Saddle](http://jeffco.us/openspace/openspace_T56_R58.htm) (which lived up to its name), then the Lookout Mountain trail. At the top of that trail up by the nature preserve, we were at just shy of 5 miles. Some of the group decided to turn around. A few others decided to run out a quarter mile to [Buffalo Bill&#8217;s grave](http://www.buffalobill.org/). There were a few guys who planned to get a few more miles in, so I tagged along with them (confession: I actually thought they were doing the Buffalo Bill&#8217;s addition, not another 5 miles. I realized my mistake within a few hundred yards but just went along with it). We continued along the path and met up with the Apex Trail, and the Hardscrabble path.

Once there were only the three of us, the guys really picked it up on the downhills, but it was great for me to be pushing it. I know that my trail downhills are an area I need to work on. We soon hit 7.5 miles and prepared to head back. There was a bit of uphill right past the turnaround which actually was tough, but soon enough we were back at the top of the nature preserve and ready to come down and I felt pretty good. It&#8217;d been about 2 hours and one of the guys, Tony, said he figured we&#8217;d be down in a half hour. I figured that was pretty aggressive, but didn&#8217;t say anything. 

We actually made it back to our cars 35 minutes later, but we managed to somehow find a shortcut that lead us to skip the wall-climb and the steep slope. All of us were just fine with the shortened distance.

In all, we ran 14.05miles in 2:35:14. Surprisingly I averaged a 152 heart rate, maxing out at 177 (I figured it would have been higher). I carried my homemade energy gel and some powerbar bites in my waist pouch ([Meredith](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/) had sent me a gel flask that worked perfectly!) and a handheld water bottle. It was exactly what I needed. 

Today was just one of those days where I marveled that I have trails like this so nearby. It&#8217;s mid-November and I can go out in capris and a long-sleeved shirt and frolic over paths for hours at a time. I&#8217;m so fortunate..
