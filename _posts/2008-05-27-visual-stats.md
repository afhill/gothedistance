Many of us like to compare our times with the rest of the field. I just looked up a friend&#8217;s results using [runpix.com](http://www.runpix.info/vmt08/42/finord.php?LastName=1089&lan=&aset=0), and they have a great interface to do so! When you enter the name or bib number of an individual, you get back a visual representation of how the fared overall, within their gender and within their age group. The math is all done for you. There are several screens that show you how you finished in relation to other runners (in your division or not), your overall pace as well as your pace through different parts of the course, and a map showing where you were on the course when others finished. How much fun!  
It&#8217;s a great interface that provides a runner or a fan with the sort of information they&#8217;re interested in (and more!) I hope someday to run a race where they provide the stats!

(For the record, my friend Jen, with whom I ran the Flying Pig, just PRed and BQed again :))
