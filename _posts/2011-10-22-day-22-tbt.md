I&#8217;m really disappointed that most of the other people on this TBT2.0 don&#8217;t seem to be blogging. That&#8217;s great if everyone is doing the program, but part of the fun is seeing what others are up to, finding food or workout ideas. I&#8217;m going to stick with it, but it&#8217;s less fun when I go to check in with my support group and don&#8217;t find any üôÅ

Food &#8211; Cheat Day  
&#8211; sweet potato cornbread with earth balance  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; honeymilk post-run  
&#8211; smoothie: ff milk, cacao nibs, blueberries, banana, hemp seed  
&#8211; banana, almond butter, hemp seed in a whole wheat tortilla  
&#8211; apple  
&#8211; Propel zero  
&#8211; beer  
&#8211; veggie quesadilla (inc cheese)  
&#8211; black bean burger  
&#8211; french fries  
&#8211; frozen yogurt with toppings (32nd Treat has Bhakti Chai froyo!)  
&#8211; Reese&#8217;s peanut butter cup

Exercise  
&#8211; 10.4miles at 8:21 pace. I wanted to get a good run in before the afternoon&#8217;s fun. My official training plan called for 18 miles at 8:23 so I set that pace.  
&#8211; 10ish mile Great Denver Beer Run. We basically did a pub crawl, running. 6 different breweries: Strange Brewing, Breckenridge, Renegade, Great Divide, Wynkoop and Denver Beer Company, and it started and ended at Highland Tap and Burger (close to home). Great fun! Many of the runners are part of the Run Club out of the Highland Tap and Burger &#8211; they run Wed nights. I&#8217;ll be joining them üôÇ
