Mileage:136.6  
Hit 1000 miles for the year!  
Two races: 50k and a half. Big pr on the ultra,despite no significant long runs since the flying pig  
Also saw the Dean Karnazes movie, which was a good motivator  
I feel really good although my nails have started to split which can be a sigh of a nutritional deficiency or a weakened immune system. Need to keep an eye on that! 

oh, and I wrote this out on the wordpress iphone app.
