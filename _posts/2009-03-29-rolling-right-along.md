It appears my mother doesn&#8217;t know me well at all; she called at 7pm after reading on twitter that [I wasn&#8217;t feeling well](http://twitter.com/afhill262/status/1414081139) and left a message saying she hoped I was taking it easy.. I was at derby practice!

<!--more-->Last night was the Denver Roller Dolls Season Opener. There are three home teams in the League, so two teams played against each other and then the Bad Apples played against a team from Ft Collins. I haven&#8217;t been drafted to a team yet, so I served as &#8220;demo doll&#8221;, skating before the bout as the rules were explained to the audience, and then worked the merch table.

While I didn&#8217;t get a chance to watch as much as I would have liked, it was just overall a really exciting environment to be in! In a month I may be invited to &#8220;test-up&#8221;, and if I test to an A- or an A level, I will be eligible for the draft. Only A skaters are eligible to play in bouts. After last week&#8217;s practice I wasn&#8217;t feeling very great and I was thinking it would be a long while before I made it to a bout. 

Tonight, though, we had a small practice as most of the experienced skaters had been in the bout yesterday so took today off. We had two visiting skaters from a new league in Castle Rock, and then 10 other skaters &#8211; I believe 7 newly inducted skaters, and 3 more experienced skaters. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because most of us were at about the same level, but I left the practice feeling less discouraged than I have been lately.  
We got through many more drills than usual and it was a tough practice (we were all dripping sweat at the end) but it was really good! Hey, how can you not like playing freeze tag on roller skates?? 

So no, when Mom called I wasn&#8217;t relaxing, but I did get my head in a better place! 

Go DRD!
