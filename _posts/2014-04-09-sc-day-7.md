Today was my first day on the cleanse at work. Work can be dangerous as we have a lot of chips and trail mix and stuff. Overall healthy-ish, but not cleanse-worthy. 

I woke up at 5am for no good reason, so I decided to get up and go to the gym at work. I grabbed some baked granola, a mason jar of yesterday&#8217;s pho and some strawberries for lunch. Caught the 5:38 bus and was in Denver by 6:15 or so. I was texting and walking and managed to step in a tree-well just outside the station and wiped out hard! Broke the mason jar, and skinned my hand and my right(!) knee. So much for bringing my lunch to work &#8211; but I was actually more grateful that it was the soup and not the baked granola that was lost ðŸ™‚ However, that meant I had to go buy lunch and after all the amazing salads I had in Boston, this one from Smiling Moose Deli was a SEVERE disappointment!

TianChi  
Baked Granola with soymilk  
Green tea  
orange  
banana  
salad (lettuce, spinach, cucumber, tomato, corn, banana pepper, chickpeas) with balsamic  
mixed nuts  
quinoa with hummus, grape tomatoes, and citrus and ginger kraut  
kombucha

I had a really good workout: did some arms and shoulders, some legs and then rode the Expresso bike. I really like that thing!
