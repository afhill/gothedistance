#### Food

  * protein pancakes

  * tea

  * banana, pb, hemp seed in a whole wheat tortilla
  * fruitein protein shake with low-fat milk
  * vegetarian pho
  * mango

I tracked my food via [LiveStrong&#8217;s MyPlate](http://www.livestrong.com/myplate/2011-04-14/) again today to get a sense of my protein/sugar intake. But, after watching that Sugar video, I&#8217;m more interested in monitoring the type of sugar, I guess I&#8217;ll need to do that on my own. According to LiveStrong, my caloric intake was too high, my fiber was too high, my protein was too high. I think I&#8217;m ok with all three values, especially given how much I work out on non-rest days! I do think it&#8217;s funny that my cholesterol intake was estimated at 15mg, whereas the expected daily intake is 301!

#### Exercise

Rest day. Although I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m seeing a ton of gains muscle-wise lately, I know I could use a day for my body to recover. As I suspected, my abs are a bit sore today from the core work yesterday (as well as my glutes).  
I also made plans to meet an old friend for a 9mile run on Sunday. Generally a day after a bout would be a rest day, but since I know I&#8217;ll get a run in, I felt it was even more important to take a real rest day!
