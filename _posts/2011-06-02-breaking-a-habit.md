I know I don&#8217;t need to blog anymore, but I&#8217;m used to it now. And, I do like the fact that others can hopefully benefit from some of the things I&#8217;m doing.  
FOR EXAMPLE.. I got a fantastic email from my Mom today, who&#8217;s started eating clean in the past few months, and has dropped weight, toned up and is feeling great! I&#8217;m so proud of her, and I&#8217;m pleased to be able to inspire üôÇ 

#### Food

  * Smoothie
  * peach
  * flax plus cereal with blueberries and kefir
  * Whole foods salad bar. Today most stuff had cheese on it üôÅ I stayed away from those offerings
  * green tea smoothie (with nf milk)
  * Sushi handroll
  * Orzo/tomato salad
  * pear, grapes
  * beanitos chips
  * vegetarian japanese healthy snack

I was working from home this morning when all of a sudden I recalled I had a chiro appointment on the southside. I grabbed my workout clothes and decided I&#8217;d work remotely and hit up the rec center after work. However, that meant I didn&#8217;t have access to lunch stuff. However, I made a pretty darn good decision if I say so myself, and holed up for most of the afternoon at Whole Foods. I did venture across the street to a smoothie/yogurt place, but stayed away from the really bad options and just had a green tea smoothie (non-fat milk). 

I hammered it hard at the rec center, which felt great. I did legs, which I haven&#8217;t for awhile. I was next to a guy at the center who was pretty serious about his workout. He had on headphones but he would give himself little muttery pep talks before a set, telling himself to focus and do what he said he was going to do. I actually admired his ability to do that in a room with people around him üôÇ 

#### Exercise

  * Leg extension (130lbs &#8211; 14, 10, 7) (85lbs &#8211; 15, 12, 10) (50lbs &#8211; 3&#215;15)
  * Hamstring curl &#8211; 50lbs 3&#215;10. Hate these, I always worry I&#8217;m straining something I shouldn&#8217;t.
