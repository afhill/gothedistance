I just got a nice call from my mechanic that my car needs $1800 worth of repairs. Merry Christmas to me üôÅ

However &#8211; I&#8217;d booked my flight with Southwest, so I was able to cancel with no penalty. I did accrue a penalty for canceling my Disney reservation within 45 days, but I&#8217;d rather spend the $200 than the $650 (+ actual expenses while I was there). 

Other positives:

  * I get two of my vacation days back!
  * I won&#8217;t compromise my Houston race
  * I don&#8217;t need to hang out by myself at &#8220;the Happiest Place on Earth&#8221; for several days
  * I know this will make my coach happy!
  * I can use my [CrossFit](http://www.crossfitlodo.com/join/) groupon

I feel a tiny twinge of disappointment, but it&#8217;s really pretty tiny. This trip was originally supposed to be with a friend, but he had to back out due to injury. As I got more focused on Houston I backed off on any big goals I had for the race, so really it&#8217;d just have been &#8220;to do it&#8221;. I&#8217;ve done enough marathons for that. 

I&#8217;d been torn about training for Houston &#8211; did I start tapering now (3 weeks before Disney) or wait a week (3 weeks before my target race). How much would the Goofy Challenge impact my performance the following week &#8211; physically as well as mentally? I&#8217;m actually seeing this change in plans as somewhat a good thing.
