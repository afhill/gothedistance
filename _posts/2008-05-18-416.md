In addition to my running blog on livejournal, I&#8217;ve maintained a &#8220;professional&#8221; one on wordpress for several years. When I first started runlikeagrrl, livejournal was a great platform.- it incorporated a notion of friending that is still more robust than what most social networking sites currently offer. However, it also has its limitations. I was a paid member for awhile, so I am acutely aware of the features I currently don&#8217;t have access to. As well, many of the running blogs I read are not on the livejournal platform, so the privacy rules don&#8217;t really apply (not to mention, I don&#8217;t really have any need to set any posts to anything but &#8220;public&#8221;).

A few weeks back I had an email exchange with [Melanie McBride](http://melaniemcbride.net/), who also works in new media and is a runner. We were discussing what we posted to our twitter accounts, how we managed those two different aspects of our personalities and interests. At that time I was using my twitter account exclusively for work and technology purposes. More recently, however, in a bit of a social experiment for work, I&#8217;ve been looking at redefining myself online. My &#8220;new&#8221; (temporary) profile is a summary view, so it combines the different aspects of me. And I actually like it! My running journal posts themselves (with the exception of race reports) are generally shorter than those on [my other blog](http://www.afhill.com/blog/). They seem perhaps better suited to microblogging. As well, I&#8217;ve run into several limitations on livejournal in terms of not being able to add certain widgets (my logyourrun stats) to my sidebar. By hosting my own journal, I&#8217;ll be able to add and modify at will. 

The final straw was a question I had this morning about multiple twitter accounts. I hadn&#8217;t really considered doing so, since I figured the ability to post to either would be challenging to manage (this is something I&#8217;m grappling with now with my work experiment). However, it appears that the twhirl AIR app already manages this, and a survey by Techcrunch France found that 53% of the folks surveyed had multiple accounts. A silly tipping point, but it is one nonetheless. That is why I&#8217;ve retired runlikeagrrl and am now go-ing the distance with wordpress.
