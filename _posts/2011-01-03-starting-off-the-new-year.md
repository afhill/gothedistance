I didn&#8217;t intend to set physical fitness resolutions, but I noticed that it&#8217;s the 3rd day of the year and I&#8217;ve:

run 12.1 miles  
attended 2 derby practices (2hrs and 2.5 hours)  
attended hot yoga

So thus far, the year has been good. I feel motivated to keep things going, although I want to be careful I don&#8217;t overdo it. In the past when I had too much going on, there came a breaking point. I want to hone my skills but not overdo it. 

Being on three teams with derby, I have a LOT of required practices (5-8hrs per week), plus there are many optional practices available. I&#8217;m enjoying my three days of running and would like to continue those, and just committed to a 10-class yoga pass. I also have a boot camp gift certificate to use at a local gym at some point. I love being active and pushing myself, I just don&#8217;t want to go too far.
