I woke up at 2:30am, so you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d have had enough sleep. However when the alarm went off for real, I was still tired. I still wanted to get a workout in, so I bundled up and headed to the gym.  
Alas, the workout was NOT as I wanted. I still felt weak and blah, and didn&#8217;t bench press anything near what I wanted. I did do some lunges and glute work to somewhat justify the trip in Colorado&#8217;s latest snowfall, but it was pretty weak. 

I was reasonably hungry all day, but lazy on the food prep front. 

Finally after work I decided to enjoy the cool crisp air and log some miles, and it felt amazing! I ran with music, which is a rarity, and just felt great. how can you not feel peaceful in this?
