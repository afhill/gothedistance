I just realized that May 21st is supposedly the end of the world. That&#8217;s also the end of my TBT. Makes you wonder if all this work was worth it, doesn&#8217;t it? Maybe I should take my pics on the 20th&#8230; ðŸ˜‰

Today was my first day in the new office (next door to the gym). I met my trainer at the gym at 6, showered and walked to whole foods for breakfast, and was in the office nice and early. Then at 5pm I headed back to the gym for a fun 30min abs class before grabbing dinner and heading to practice. I took a bazi shot and got myself really mentally excited for scrimmage, which I don&#8217;t always do. It went great! I felt strong and our team (the Electrocuties) really played well together. We had team practice yesterday and I think we&#8217;re going to get together one more time before our bout on the 21st. We lost our first bout by a wide margin but I know we&#8217;re much more cohesive and strong and I&#8217;m super excited to skate with them! Scrimmage with MHC also went really well, the team is definitely coming together. (I may have had a 25 or 30pt jam- thanks, blockers!!) We chatted a bit about Sundays bout and now are ready to move forward.  
Joy Collision from Charm City came to our scrimmage tonight, It&#8217;s fun to see different skaters and their approach. She said I looked &#8220;tiny and fit&#8221;. I gave her the 30sec TBT elevator pitch ðŸ™‚

  * Good workout with Rebeccah this morning, we did a fair amount of stabilization. I did squats with one leg on a slidey thing where I stayed stable on one leg and moved the other, and then later did a plank with my toes on a swiss ball and did alternating toe taps on the ground. Fun times! She also tried to show me how to do a one-armed snatch, and I managed to hit myself with the weight. Ugh&#8230; 
  * 30min &#8220;Mad Abs&#8221; class at the gym &#8211; the instructor said she liked having me there to demonstrate!
