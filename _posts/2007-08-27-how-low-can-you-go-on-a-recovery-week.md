I didn&#8217;t write about running last week, for good reason: I had nothing to write about.

Last Sunday, I ran three miles to bring my weekly mileage up to 51. I&#8217;d had a bit of a nagging sore throat since Saturday night, and when I woke up on Monday, it was red and inflamed. Instead of running an exciting **V02 Max 10miles with 5&#215;1,000m @ 5K pace, jog 2min between**, I left work early to see a doctor. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s strep, but we&#8217;ll treat you anyway&#8221; and I was off with antibiotics.

Honestly, the weather helped make it easy to take some time off. We got something like 5 weeks worth of rainfall in three days. It was also a big week at work &#8212; I put in 51hrs, and that wasn&#8217;t including the half day I took on Tuesday, and the half day &#8220;summer event&#8221; we had at work on Friday! 

Ah yes, Friday put a kink in my plans as well &#8212; we had a work &#8216;party&#8217; which lead to my sleeping in on Saturday and skipping our long run that day. Yup, I logged exactly 0 miles last week. 

I was prepared to start this week &#8216;fresh&#8217;, and had a few minor roadblocks again &#8212; last night my eye was sore so I took allergy meds, but it was goopy this morning, so I am a bit worried it&#8217;s pinkeye (which can be caused by a bacterial infection.. and I neer actually finished all my antibiotics from the week before). I still managed to get up and head to Arcadia to run on the track &#8212; and it was locked. Geez! It was a long day at work but I stuck to my guns and headed to New Albany after work and managed to do my workout. So I&#8217;m back..

I&#8217;ll admit, I was a bit sore, but I was impressed I did the workout. It was 85 I think? So not as hot as it has been, but still plenty warm.

3mi warmup: 8:39 pace  
1,000m: 6:45 pace (AvgHR: 185, MaxHR: 191)  
1,000m: 6:48 pace (AvgHR: 187, MaxHR: 193)  
1,000m: 6:45 pace (AvgHR: 177, MaxHR: 191)  
1,000m: 6:51 pace (AvgHR: 179, MaxHR: 187)  
1,000m: 6:50 pace (AvgHR: 176, MaxHR: 189)  
cooldown: 9:28 pace

So the goal of the repeats is &#8220;5K pace&#8221;. However, I don&#8217;t really train for or race many 5K races. So if I always stuck to that pace, I would never really be increasing the intensity from training program to training program. So I did a little&#8230; overestimating. My current 5K PR is a 7:04 pace. I feel that&#8217;s pretty soft, so I set my garmin &#8220;training pace&#8221; to a 6:30 &#8211; 7:10 range. Now I will admit I don&#8217;t have 100% faith in these training ranges with the garmin. I assume it looks at your average speed over time rather than instantaneous, because there were a few times it was beeping at me for going too fast when I definitely felt I was not, or other times it would say I was going closer to 7:30 but it wasn&#8217;t beeping. However, when I look at the numbers above, I guess I should have faith that their averaging system works out&#8230; 

Tomorrow is a rest day, and then Meredith had mentioned trying to do her long run on Wednesday rather than Saturday. I may try to do it with her, since I missed my long run last Saturday. Not that it would be really smart to do one on Wed and one and Sat, but&#8230;. :/

Did I mention the potential attendees for Vegas are now:  
me (full)  
mi Mama (half)  
Helen (full)  
Meredith (half)  
Dave (?) (half)

How much fun would that be, to have my Boston girls in Vegas! Helen and Dave both have 31st birthdays that weekend.. what a better way to spend a b-day than in Vegas&#8230; well&#8230;.. probably not running&#8230;.
