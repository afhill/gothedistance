Tonight I made my own energy gel! Since I&#8217;ve been eating clean, I haven&#8217;t really wanted to take a ton of PowerGels or Gus. I decided to try making some based off a recipe I found from [No Meat Athlete](http://www.nomeatathlete.com/homemade-energy-gel-chia/). I had everything at home already save the fruit pectin, and then threw in some cinnamon, just because cinnamon makes everything better.

Ingredients: baking soda, salt substitute (ok, I just used sea salt), chia seeds, orange pulp, pineapple, brown rice syrup, fruit pectin.

I blended it up after putting all the ingredients together so I don&#8217;t have big kernels of chia, and while it looks funky, it doesn&#8217;t smell half-bad.

The next challenge will be portability. Years ago I had a gel flask but I have no idea where it is now. I don&#8217;t really like fuel belts so I&#8217;ll have to figure something out (if the stuff turns out to be edible!)

**Update:** This stuff is delicious! Now if I can just figure out a container. I&#8217;ve been trying to eat it out of a snack baggie and it&#8217;s sorta a mess.
