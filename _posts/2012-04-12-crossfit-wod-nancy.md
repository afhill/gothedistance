Today was another named workout. I looked it up last night and thought it seemed a bit boring, but definitely do-able:

> 5 reps for time:
> 
>   * 400m run
>   * 15 overhead squats

My knee was a bit achy from my run less than 12 hours prior, so I was a bit conservative in my weight for the bar. The prescribed weight was 65# for girls, I just stuck with the 30# bar. 

I had my garmin on to check if this really was a 400m loop &#8211; and the non-surprising answer is that it&#8217;s a bit short. The 5 laps should have been 1.25miles and instead it came out to 1.18. Still, I was happy to have my garmin for my paces. 

The first two laps I didn&#8217;t hit reset, my average pace was 6:48.  
My third lap was 6:45, fourth was 6:32 and my final lap was at a 6:28 pace. 

The overhead squats were actually not near as bad as I thought. Once I was figured out the secret of activating my shoulders, the weight didn&#8217;t seem so awkward. I did each set unbroken, which the coach had said was a sign the weight wasn&#8217;t heavy enough. Whoops! I was definitely glad I went light and got the technique down, though. 

I was the first to finish, in 12:01. Fun! 

For dessert we did shoot-throughs and planks, tabata style. I loved the idea of the shoot-throughs but it kicked my butt after the first round!
