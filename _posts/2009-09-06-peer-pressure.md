Three days ago, [Chuck &#8220;Marathonjunkie&#8221; Engle](http://www.marathonjunkie.com) emailed me to say he was coming into town this weekend to run the [American Distance Trail marathon](http://www.adtmarathon.com) just outside Colorado Springs. I didn&#8217;t have any big plans for the long weekend, so I didn&#8217;t even hesitate, and signed up.

One of the volunteers at Pikes Peak had told me about this race, a steady downhill primarily on dirt road:

I&#8217;m excited; I had decided to take Minneapolis off the race calendar for a number of reasons, and waiting til California to run my favorite distance again just seemed so long!

Race report to come..
