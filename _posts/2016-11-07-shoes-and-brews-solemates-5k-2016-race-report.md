It was a great fun event, and we were excited to sign up for their fall version of the race and beer festival. Sadly, Andrea was out of town but Sara and I headed up to enjoy this race on a beautiful fall day.

The course was similar to last time; from Left Hand Brewery towards a park, around a body of water, back down the bike path to Shoes and Brews. The course actually has a little bit of undulating hills, but nothing too bad.

I remembered the congestion (and lack of chip timing) from last time, so lined up fairly close to the front. I told myself not to go out too crazy; I wanted it to feel comfortably hard and not to die ðŸ™‚ So I only glanced at my watch at the mile markers, but ran by feel.

It went great! I don&#8217;t think any women passed me through the entire race. It was annoying, though, whereas the last course had us leave the bike path to run down a frontage road, this stayed on the bikepath. I kept waiting for the transition to &#8216;drop the hammer&#8217; and it never came. :-/ Â So I did pick it up at the end, but it wasn&#8217;t how I envisioned it.

Sara had forgotten her watch, but we agreed it was probably good for her to run by feel too. And I think it was, because she came across the line in a great PR time! Â  Julianne from Rev Running had run with her boyfriend as well, and when Julianne and I compared watches, we both had 3.02 miles recorded. I tried to tell Sara that a course is a course and you use that distance, but I will admit that I feel a bit uneasy reporting on my time.

My goal had been to break 22 min, with a secret goal to break 21. (and/or faster than 7mms)

Officially I ran 20:45, but that&#8217;s not so impressive if the course was actually that short. :-/

Mile 1: 7:04  
Mile 2: 6:56  
Mile 3: 6:41  
&#8212;  
Clock time: 20:45

So,  
3.02miles, that&#8217;s a 6:52 pace  
3.1 miles, that&#8217;s a 6:41 pace  
if I take the 6:52 pace and account for the shortened distance, that&#8217;d be 21:18. Still a great time, but it&#8217;s no 20:45 ðŸ˜‰

Regardless of the distance, though, I did come in 2nd in my age group, 4th woman overall. So I can&#8217;t complain about that!!

Overall the race felt pretty good. I think I ran smart, and it paid off. Gets me excited for my upcoming race season!
