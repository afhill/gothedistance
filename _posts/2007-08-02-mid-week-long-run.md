The first time you do a Pfitz plan, the mid-week long runs seems SOOOO long for during the week. Who would have thought I&#8217;d get to a point where I&#8217;m &#8220;fitting in&#8221; those long runs before work? Granted, I got so used to driving for an hour and a half before work that running for that long doesn&#8217;t seem too rough..

This past Wednesday, I had a hair appointment after work so I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to meet Mike and Meredith. There was also a work sponsored happy hour being held at 5, AND the forecast was for 90-some degree weather. I was actually somewhat grateful I&#8217;d be going out at 6:15am!

I will admit, 11 miles is a long way before work. I was pretty brain-dead when I did eventually get to work! But I have always loved running in the morning, so overall it wasn&#8217;t bad. I ran the bike trail &#8216;backwards&#8217;, from downtown towards worthington. I actually found I was running at a faster clip than expected. I knew I was picking it up on the second half, but I didnt realize how consistently I was speeding up with every mile&#8230;

Overall: 1:37:32 (8:52 pace). avg hr: 162, max: 180.

Splits:  
9:54  
9:11  
9:18  
9:07  
8:50  
8:49  
8:38  
8:48  
8:20  
8:26  
8:08

Today was my &#8216;off&#8217; day. I made it to the gym tonight, did a fair amount of abs, as well as some arms work. I don&#8217;t want to tire my legs out too much so I mostly focussed on stretching them, etc. I recently got it in my mind that I want a deep tissue massage. I think it will hurt immensely, but I think afterwards it will feel sooooo good!
