I&#8217;ve always felt like I recovered quickly. I could run a marathon and get out there and hit the roads a day or two later.

After Houston my coach had me take a whole week off, then ease back into running slowly. I took it to be more of a mental break. He&#8217;s expressed concern that running the Pikes Peak marathon in August will impact my Columbus marathon in October, which seemed a bit silly to me. 

HOWEVER&#8230; he may know what he&#8217;s talking about. I did the Leadville marathon two weekends ago and while I took a few days off afterwards, I really didn&#8217;t drop my mileage too much, nor the intensity. 

What did change? The effort for sure. My past few hard workouts have been really hard. In the past two workouts I&#8217;d settle into at 7:18 pace when I should have been going at 6:40. I just didn&#8217;t feel like I could push harder. 

I think I;m going to go to AllSports later and jump on their spin bike and suck in some super oxygen-saturated air and just let the legs go. They&#8217;re not painful, I just am having trouble getting them to go! 

It&#8217;s crazy how an event you train for can leave you a bit ragged like that, but I guess it&#8217;s a sign of working hard and &#8216;leaving it on the course&#8217;. Also, my workouts are more intense than those &#8220;head out and log a couple miles&#8217; runs I used to do most of the time, so I can tell the impacts of the marathon. 

Things to remember when I get all excited about signing up for a race.. there ARE training effects!
