It&#8217;s only three days a week, Andrea. So how come you can&#8217;t get the workouts in?

Yes, this weekend&#8217;s long run (15 miles @ 8:43) was a bust. I hate that I can see myself unintentionally sabotaging my training. I&#8217;ve always felt that the long run was the crux of marathon training, and it&#8217;s just not happening. 

Today I had a meeting from 9-2:30. Tomorrow I have a 5K at 10am, then derby practice from 12-3. I wanted my long run to be outside and so I wanted to do it this afternoon. But by the time I got home and changed and set out, it was already 4 and starting to get chilly. Granted, I could have grabbed my headlight but I honestly forgot until I was a few miles out. Also, after doing my 11 miler yesterday I wasn&#8217;t feeling mentally prepared for the 8:43 pace so I told myself to just go out and run. So my run was short in distance AND off in pace:

Target: 15 miles at 8:43  
Actual: 5 miles at 9:40

And will next week be better? Let&#8217;s see, I have a derby bout Saturday night in Colorado Springs. So I wont run Saturday, and I am already guessing I won&#8217;t be able to pull off 20 miles at 8:53.

UGH! I hate that I see the plan crumbling, and I know it&#8217;s my fault. But, at least if I can feel some satisfaction in knocking out the week speed workouts, at least I&#8217;m preparing that way.
