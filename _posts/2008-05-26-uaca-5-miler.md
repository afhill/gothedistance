Today was the Upper Arlington Memorial Day 5 Miler. I&#8217;d never run this race before, but [Dave](http://notesandlines.blogspot.com) and [Meredith](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com) run it every year, and Helen had also asked if I was going to run. Despite the fact that my legs were probably a \*little\* tired from 40 miles of cycling this weekend, I decided to give it a try. 

We all met together before the race, Mary was there as well. I kept saying &#8220;this is going to suck&#8221;. I&#8217;m so not used to short races! I knew my PR was 37:05 (a 7:24 pace) but I didn&#8217;t really think that was in reach. 

As soon as we started, I pulled ahead. I felt like I was just doing a healthy jog &#8211; not killing myself like I would at a 5K. I also told myself that I wasn&#8217;t going to monitor my pace in real time, I was just going to take a look at it per mile. 

I felt all right from the start, hitting the first mile at 7:24. Already before the second mile, Mary and Helen had caught up and passed me. Mary actually caught up with me just after a steady decent on the course. I asked her if she&#8217;d run it before; she hadn&#8217;t. I feared that Dave and Meredith, who were behind us and the only veterans of the course, knew something we didn&#8217;t. 

I hit the second mile at a 7:20 pace. By this time my heart rate was already up to 188. I was chugging along, but certainly not enjoying it. Miles 3 and 4 were hilly, and my heart rate crested up to 190. My pace for the two miles was 7:38 and 7:59. In mile 4 the overall ascent was 142ft, the overall descent was 92ft.

Finally we hit the last mile (and the second waterstop of the course). I could see Helen up ahead, but knew there was no chance to catch her. I pulled in the last mile (according to my garmin) in 7:23 and my heart rate hit the highest it seems to get: 197. The garmin also measured the course to 5.02 and this last 129 feet somehow came in at a 5:20mm, with my heart rate sitting at 197. I had set my sights on the only girl between Helen and had to put her behind me before I hit the chutes. I did so, my watch beeping away (I think it was asking what the @#$ I was doing!)

According to my garmin, I finished the race in 37:54, which is a 7:32 pace. Overall I&#8217;m pretty happy with that, considering how challenging the course was. I also picked up some more hardware: 3rd in my age group (Helen picked up the plaque for 2nd). Mary had also picked up 2nd in her age group (youngun that she is). Soon enough we saw Dave and Meredith &#8211; Dave PRed, as he&#8217;d expected. We chatted for awhile, then headed over for some free ice cream. Note for all Race Directors out there: free ice cream is a great idea!

So overall, I&#8217;m happy with how things went. I really think I need to learn how to train and pace for shorter races, because I feel like I should be able to do better. I also think that maybe 197 isn&#8217;t my max heart rate, because it seems weird to me that I&#8217;d be able to hit it fairly frequently in shorter races.
