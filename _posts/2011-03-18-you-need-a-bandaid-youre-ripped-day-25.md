A friend sent me a text today with the title of this post. Totally cheesy, but it cracked me up!

#### Food

  * 7:30: smoothie- yogurt, cantaloupe, orange, banana, spinach, carrot, hemp protein powder, flax seed, chia seed, tofu
  * 9:00-cottage cheese, orange, tea
  * 10:00-apple, cashews
  * 11:30-chai from machine
  * 12:30-brown rice, veggie tempeh, steamed carrots, lentil salad
  * 2:30 apple, tea
  * 4:00 odwalla superfood drink -I&#8217;ve been trying not to drink calories but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been drinking enough lately and thought I&#8217;d mix it up
  * 5:00 banana and pb in a whole wheat tortilla
  * 9:30-definitely too long between meals! Smoked salmon, spinach and green onion on dr. Kracker flatbread. Beets. Almond butter, hemp seed, chia seed and banana in a whole wheat tortilla. honestly I probably didn&#8217;t need the banana burrito but I started eating the salmon in the tortilla and didn&#8217;t like it, but didn&#8217;t want to waste the tortilla. 

#### Exercise:

Shoulder day! Shoulders are my current favorite ðŸ™‚

  * Ezbar rear delt (30lbs-15), (50lbs-15,15,12)
  * External rotation (12lbs-3&#215;15)
  * Straight arm front raise (10lbs-3&#215;10)
  * Lateral raise: (10lbs-4&#215;5)
  * Arnold press-(15lbs-13,10,9),(12lbs-6)
  * Shoulder press pulses-(30lbs-3&#215;50)
  * Back flyes-(10lbs-3&#215;15)

I also decided to just do a minute of stuff here and there through the day. 

  * 1min pushups: 38
  * 1min pushups: 35
  * 1min potty squat
  * 1min bootstrappers: 31
  * 1min bootstrappers: 41
  * 1min bootstrappers: 42

I was at my old apartment today and found two old health assessments.  
Jan 2009: 118, 15.5% body fat  
March 2010: 120, 18% body fat  
Jan 2011: 111, 16.2% body fat. 

Realizing I was at 15.5 before when I was only running (and not eating well), I feel pretty confident I can get down to 15%.
