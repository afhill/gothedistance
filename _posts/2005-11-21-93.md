uh, yeah. maybe the day after I ran 15 miles is NOT the day to see how my speed is doing.

I had this brillant plan to do  
.5mi @ ~9:15  
1mi @ 7:00  
.5mi @ ~9>15

I made it through the 9:15 ok, although my left quad was a bit tight. I barely squeaked through a third of a mile at 7, and then I lowered the speed waaay down and shuffled just to get a mile in.

but hey, it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve run during the week since October!

p.s. still hate the treadmill.
