Today I ran around Chautaqua&#8217;s Skunk Canyon for the first time in over a year. And although I know my knee has plenty of improvement to come, I had a great realization: this setback is going to make me a better trail runner. 

When I had to &#8216;relearn&#8217; to run again after my [mosaicplasty knee surgery](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2013/06/seriously-super-surgery-with-dr-david-grauer-and-flatiron-surgery-center/), I decided to focus on developing more of a forefoot rather than a heel-strike. It&#8217;s been slow coming as I got used to it, but on the trails today I could definitely see the advantages. 

By switching so I was landing more over my center of gravity, I feel much more stable. I&#8217;m also engaging my core much more, so I feel like I&#8217;ll be able to be much more agile (as soon as I can get my leg firing as quickly as I want to). Lastly, I am hoping that my unlucky habit of landing weirdly on my left and twisting my ankle may be solved with this new gait. 

So even though I lost basically a year of good training, I&#8217;m focusing on the positives. I do love the trails and I feel like this is going to be a very good thing&#8230; 

oh, and I saw one bunny and six deer on the trail.
