I thought these things were all supposed to have girl names???

After Tuesday wasn&#8217;t so bad, Loren and I decided to go back to Crossfit this morning. I actually went to the correct location! It was only the two of us and one other girl (Whit, who was there on Tues as well).

>   * 3 sets of: 
>       * 250m row sprint
>       * 8 one-arm Kettle Bell Thrusters on Each side
>   * rest 2min
>   * 6 sets of: 
>       * 8 deadlifts @ 50% 1RM
>       * 2 handstand pushups

We started out covering the basics again &#8211; I&#8217;d forgotten what thrusters were but I like them ðŸ™‚ Basically a low squat with a kettlebell in the rack position and then you thrust it up as you stand. I think I had a 25#er

I wasn&#8217;t sure what my 1-rep max for the deadlift was, but because I hurt my back last time we did deadlifts, I tried to keep it nice and light. I think I ended up with 75lbs? 

We also had to be shown how to do handstand pushups. I had a couple ab mats beneath my head to specify my target, but it wasn&#8217;t actually very hard at all, I was really surprised!

We got started and Loren was the first finished the first set, I was a couple seconds behind at 6:42. After our 2-min recovery we got started and she finished one second ahead of me in 12:14. Whit finished the first set behind us but somehow lapped us in the second set and finished ahead. Yes, that means I was last in something, and was ok with it. This is a good sign! 

Oddly enough, all our times were faster than the 5:30 group, even though many of them had finished their first set much faster. I mentioned it to the coach and he said that that was the nature of the different types of exercises. In the earlier class, a couple guys had powered through the row, very aggressively and competitively, but then the handstand pushups killed them, He said all of us were very fluid in our transitions. 

Then &#8220;dessert&#8221; was 50 reverse situps &#8211; we started on our backs with our legs extended, feet hovering just above the ground. Pulled them all the way up so we were doing a shoulder stand, then lowered them back down to hover. 

As we put our weights away, I told the coach (he&#8217;s the CFE guy) about the pump and run and he thought it was a really cool concept. He then said he&#8217;d love to see some triathlons incorporate some exercises during transitions.. yeah, not sure how that would go over ðŸ˜‰

So, another day of crossfit, another GOOD workout that I enjoyed. Huh&#8230; who knew.. I AM starting to enjoy this stuff&#8230;!
