It is not good to be 30 because: I would have won the 25-29 age group. Instead, I got 5th in the 30-34.  
It is not good to wear a garmin during a race because: according to my garmin, I ran 6.27mi.

I ran 48:06 and missed setting a PR by 15 seconds, which was a bit of a disappointment. I still felt that I ran well, though [I was the 8th woman overall]. Doug and I ran this race [two years ago](http://runlikeagrrl.livejournal.com/2005/09/10/) when it was the &#8220;No Limits 10K&#8221;, and I ran 47:59, which is still the same pace: 7:44. 

My splits:  
7:44  
7:51  
7:44  
7:22  
8:36  
7:04  
(last .27 according to my watch: 6:22pace)

Overal I think l I ran alot stronger than last time &#8212; the slow mile involved the stair climb: I took water, climbed the stairs at a steady but slow pace, then took gatorade. I was talking to a girl who passed me on the stairs afterwards, she mentioned that I took them smart. I agree: I think it left me with something for the end of the race. 

I hit a max heart rate of 189 on the stairs, but a 196 in the final stretch. Considering I claim my max heart rate is 197, that&#8217;s kinda neat. A few people I&#8217;ve spoken to afterwards have expressed some concern &#8212; what happens if you hit your max, but I explained that it just means your max, isn&#8217;t ðŸ™‚ 

As I mention, the garmin isn&#8217;t always so great. I don&#8217;t like wondering if the course was actually long, or if I just added an extra .07 on myself (weaving, passing, etc). I&#8217;d rather just pretend that all courses are measured perfectly and those missing 0 or 15 seconds aren&#8217;t because someone measured incorrectly&#8230; ðŸ˜‰

Tomorrow is my big 17 miler! We&#8217;ll see how I feel after that..
