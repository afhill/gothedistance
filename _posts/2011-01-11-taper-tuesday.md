Wow, hard to believe it&#8217;s the last speed workout of the training plan!

I did a hard workout Saturday so decided to postpone the 10 miler from Sunday. Then yesterday when I woke up I wsas exhausted, so I skipped it altogether. Today, though, I woke up and attacked my workout with a vengeance.

And they keep getting easier..

10min warmup  
6x(400m @ 1:39), 400m RI  
10min cooldown

1: 1:37  
2: 1:35  
3: 1:35  
4: 1:35  
5: 1:32  
6: 1:33

Overall: 5 miles in 42:22. avgHR 161, maxHR 185

I feel good going into Sunday. I anticipate I&#8217;ll want to push too hard at the start, so my goal is to stick around an 8:15 pace through mile 16/20 and see how I feel from there. I know that I can start (and sometimes complete) a marathon at 8mm, but I&#8217;m not sure my endurance is quite there now. 

And then..? it&#8217;s so strange not to have the next race on the books&#8230;
