I&#8217;m actually pretty happy with this as a progress photo. The photographer actually said he was a little intimidated ðŸ™‚ 

#### Food

  * Greek yogurt, Ezekiel cereal, banana
  * rye toast with almond butter. Oh almond butter, how I&#8217;ve missed you. Maybe that&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t enjoyed oatmeal lately?
  * trail mix
  * quinoa, salad (spring mix, tomato, cucumber, hemp seed, lite raspberry vinagrette),sugar snap peas
  * apple
  * delicious salad: tofu, spinach, mango, avocado, wonton strips (whoops, just realized these are bad), ginger, tomato, cucumbers. honey mustard dressing

I decided that I need to get back to running, to determine if I&#8217;m going to run the [Colorado Colfax Half-Marathon](http://www.coloradocolfaxmarathon.org/TOUR/HALFMARATHON.aspx). Basically, I&#8217;m at a point where just running a half for the sake of running doesn&#8217;t seem worth it. But I have a half marathon goal of <1:37:00 (my PR is 1:38:44) and I've seen some great improvement in my running since I started doing interval training and eating better. I decided to see if my legs still liked to go fast, so I grabbed my [Run Less Run Faster](http://www.amazon.com/Runners-World-Less-Faster-Revolutionary/dp/159486649X) book and opened it to the section for 3:20 marathoners. _(I did this based on the [McMillan Running Calculator](http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/mcmillanrunningcalculator.htm). Basically you put in a recent race and it spits out what you should be able to run other distances in. If you can run a 3:20 marathon, you should be able to hit a 1:34:xx half. That&#8217;s obviously faster than I need, but the next training plan is for 3:30 and the equivalent half marathon time is a bit slow (1:39.xx))._ So, 5 weeks out from a target goal marathon, the workout was: 10-20min warmup, 3x1mi @ 6:22 (400m RI), 10-20min cooldown). I decided I&#8217;d aim for one fast mile, and then judge how I felt to see if I wanted to do more. I ran at the rec center, where the loop is a tenth of a mile and I could micromanage my time. By the last .2 of a mile, I was struggling! But I stuck it out and pushed through. I walked for a bit during my rest interval and considered trying for the second mile (or even a fast half mile) but decided not to. All in all, I was glad I got the full mile in; often these plans start with shorter distances as you work on the speed.  
I was very hungry today! 

Oh! My female boss came in this morning a bit late for a meeting we had. She explained that it&#8217;s because she was running late after her [C25K workout](http://www.c25k.com/)! She and her husband (my male boss &#8211; should I just use their names?) have decided they&#8217;re going to run a race in the fall (she&#8217;ll do the 5K, he&#8217;s saying he&#8217;ll do at least the 5K if not longer) so they started training today! Also we were talking about the gym membership and it sounds like almost everyone in the office has tried it out, even some folks you wouldn&#8217;t have expected to. It&#8217;s great to think about us all being healthy!
