On Wednesday I fell on my knee at practice, and have been resting, icing, compressing and elevating. The pain was at the bottom of my kneecap, and I had trouble extending (flexing?) from the knee.  
I was careful for a few days, although it did feel much better yesterday. I went for a massage last night and felt the swelling was mostly gone.  
I woke up this morning tempted to try running, but decided I didn&#8217;t want to risk pushing it. This morning I rode on the trainer for an hour and a half, and did a lot of stretching to really be careful. Eventually this afternoon I decided to try running a bit, and I did some easy outdoor running of a few miles (including a few laps on the track shoeless, which actually felt really good).  
I&#8217;m now being extra careful to stretch and ice to make sure I&#8217;m recovered, but I&#8217;m definitely glad Wednesday&#8217;s injury isn&#8217;t more than just a speedbump I can get over.
