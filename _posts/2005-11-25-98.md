Took the day off as an excuse to run down to the gym this morning to work out. It was pretty chilly, so I layered up, and decided on a whim to try out my camelbak as well. Sure, I was going to feel a bit silly running two miles with a hydration pack, but no one needed to know, and I figured it was better to try it out on a short run.

It was actually pretty handy, as I threw my keys, membership card and id into one pocket and used the cinch strap to attach my workout towel. At first I was concerned that the sloshing noise would bother me, but it was fine. Drinking on the run was super easy. My one question was what to do with the mouthpiece when I wasn&#8217;t drinking! Do I leave it in my mouth? Let it hang? Hold it in my hand? Hmmmm, need to do some further investigating.

The gym was good, I did a nice lil circuit although my back was hurting again a bit this morning when I woke up so I didn&#8217;t do as much ab work as I would have liked. Felt great to be back at it though!

Run home was nice and easy. The sun is shining, but there&#8217;s a cold wind, the kind that makes your eyes tear. Hopefully it will be a bit nicer for my long run tomorrow (goal is 16 &#8211; 18)
