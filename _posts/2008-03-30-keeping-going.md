it was cold and spitting a bit today, so we decided not to run outside. I headed to the gym, still planning on doing the 10 miles. I started, but immediately just felt stiff and &#8220;non-fluid&#8221;. I knew I didn&#8217; have anything to prove, so I reset my goals to run 4 miles so that I would at least hit 40 for the week.  
So I ran my four miles, somewhat keeping an eye on my heart rate to keep it below 153:

Time: 39:49 (9:57 pace) &#8211; avgHR 149, maxHR 161.  
At the end of the run I was glad to get off the treadmill. I headed over to the weights to do some lunges and such, since I was feeling tight. It only took 6 weighted lunges before my left knee felt a shot of pain in it! It continued through a few more before I stopped.

It didn&#8217;t hurt while I ran, which was a good thing. But definitely something to watch out for over the upcoming weeks. I haven&#8217;t been very diligent about taking glucosamine for awhile now, perhaps I should err on the side of caution and start taking it again.. however, it&#8217;s the day after a long run so I don&#8217;t think that stiffness is too unusual!
