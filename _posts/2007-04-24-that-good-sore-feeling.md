I&#8217;ve missed my last few long weekends runs (literally, I&#8217;ve missed them. I love my weekend runs!), so today I took off from work early to head over to John Bryan. I knew I wanted to get in a good run, but I didn&#8217;t really have a good idea of what that meant. I ended up running out 55 min through three trails, and then I came to a fork in the road. I decided to just turn around and go back.. and somehow managed to cut 4 minutes off that first trail on the way back. My guess is that I took an accidental shortcut. In the end, the &#8216;back&#8217; took 52 minutes, so I ran about 1:45. I was pretty pooped at the end, but in general, it was a great run! Got me feeling good mentally as well as physically. This weekend I&#8217;d done a bunch of work in the garden so I was sore, so I was REALLY sore last night, but it was that good healthy feeling.
