The first thing I thought when the alarm went off at 4:30 this morning? Practice at 9pm is gonna be rough.. this morning was the Bolder Boulder, which went awesome. Then this afternoon I got a delicious massage. Practice actually wasn&#8217;t too bad, although some sprints and quick stops/cuts near the end twinged my inner thigh a bit :-/

#### Food

  * almond butter and banana on healthy grain toast, raspberries
  * tea: blended ginger peach, seattle chai, yerba mate
  * vega sport performance optimizer

  * smoothie
  * Whole food buffet &#8211; no tofu, plenty of beans and veggies, plus pita chips and guac
  * coconut water
  * kombucha. They were regular $3, on for 99c, AND two for one. I know why. I only drank about a third of it
