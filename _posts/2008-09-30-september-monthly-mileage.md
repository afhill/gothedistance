After an off month in August, I got back in the swing of things in September. I did miss one day of running.

Mileage: 144.8  
I hit 40 mpw twice this month, and would have done it a third time if I hadn&#8217;t missed that \*ahem\* 20 miler last weekend..  
I&#8217;m now officially in taper for the Denver marathon, so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll make up that 20. The fact is, I&#8217;ve done 5 runs of 20+ miles this year (3 marathons, 1 ultra and 1 in training), I know how to do it.

I&#8217;ve been doing some workouts with Meredith where we push the speed a little bit, those are feeling pretty good. I think that while running every day is good from a discipline standpoint, I also like the effort of actually focusing on a workout.
