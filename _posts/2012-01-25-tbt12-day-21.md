I felt like crud this morning. I blame coffee and poor sleep. As the day went on, I started to feel better, but I still decided to use this as a rest day. 

#### Food

&#8211; scrambled eggs with spinach, tomato, avocado  
&#8211; homemade blackberry and ginger kombucha. Lately my homemade kombucha has been really tart but the berry in this made it nice!  
&#8211; [platinum hydrobuilder](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/platinum-hydrobuilder.html) strawberry protein shake with almond milk. (This was a free sample I received, see below) At first it tasted ok but the artificial sweeteners were too much for me. Nope, not clean. üôÅ  
&#8211; tea (with some added [maca](http://ezinearticles.com/?Maca---A-True-Superfood-That-Can-Boost-Energy,-Fight-Stress-and-Boost-the-Immune-System---Part-1&id=4215358) to offset the stress from the coffee yesterday)  
&#8211; Yak and Yeti buffet. I had brown rice and stayed away from the naan. I ate a ton, which I think also helped me to feel a bit better.  
&#8211; banana  
&#8211; quorn chikn cutlet, black beans, red pepper, cilantro, tomato diced in a whole spelt tortilla (typing this out now, why didn&#8217;t I have avocado??)  
&#8211; cashews  
&#8211; vega whole food optimizer with coconut milk

#### Recovery

My left leg was achy today after my run yesterday so I was sure to stretch and roll it out. I wanted to run again today but I know it&#8217;s more important to let it heal. Instead, I went and officially joined [AllSports Recovery Club](http://allsportsrecovery.com/). I used the compression boots for 30 minutes, then got a 15 minute massage from Peter. The massage was awesome! He worked on my legs and glutes, and really got some tender spots. So much better than an hour at massage envy, as I felt like he knew what parts would be sore for an athlete and did some massage where he rotated my leg as he dug in to really get deep. Yowch!  
After leaving, I felt SO much better it was really hard not to think about working out again, but I&#8217;m forcing myself to really let my body heal. 

#### Supplements!

Today I got a huge shipment from bodybuilding.com. They always have sales and deals on, and also let you order free samples of products. So I bought SuperPump and Monster Amino, and got all this: 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120125-181504.jpg" alt="20120125-181504.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120125-181504.jpg)

&#8211; [Gaspari SuperPump Max](http://www.gasparinutrition.com/products/superpumpmax/). I ordered this for pre-workout. I&#8217;ve started reading more about the importance of NO and although I don&#8217;t quite understand what it does to help you, I figured I&#8217;d give it a try.  
&#8211; [Gaspari Qualitine](http://www.gasparinutrition.com/products/qualitine/) is creatine. I already use creatine, but this was included with my purchase of the Superpump, so now I guess I have more.  
&#8211; [Cytosport Monster Amino](http://www.cytosport.com/products/monster-milk/monster-amino). I&#8217;ve run low on my BCAA supplement and the brand I was using was discontinued so I needed to buy more. I ended up with this brand, despite the fact I&#8217;m not really a big fan of Cytomax or Muscle Milk. But it seems most BCAA supplements are capsules, and I really wanted a powder. This also has an 8:1:1 ratio which is purports is superior to the 2:1:1 ratio found in most other supplements.  
&#8211; AND, it came with free [L-Glutamine](http://www.cytosport.com/products/specialty/l-glutamine), so.. bonus! (Note: I also already had some glutamine in the cupboard and I am still struggling with trying to figure when I&#8217;m supposed to time all this stuff..)  
&#8211; Although I bought SuperPump Max for pre-workout, I also ordered a free sample of [C4 Extreme](http://cellucor.com/product/c4-extreme). It is supposedly a fusion of nitrate and creatine?  
&#8211; I don&#8217;t actually remember ordering [Optimum Nutrition HydroBuilder](http://www.optimumnutrition.com/products/platinum-hydrobuilder-p-277.html), but there were a couple samples thrown in. Basically, it&#8217;s a protein drink with a lot of amino acids AND creatine already in there. I had one today but I thought the taste (with almond milk) was a little too sweet for me.  
&#8211; [HICA-Max Growth Muscle Stimulator](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffXEje3j1xk) is little tablets that look like candy (and have two sweeteners, so probably taste like candy too). The idea is that it&#8217;s much more powerful than BCAAs. Given the sweeteners, I don&#8217;t even know that I&#8217;ll try this free sample.  
&#8211; [TwinLab Power Fuel](http://www.twinlab.com/product/new-power-fuel%C2%AE-powder) is another pre-workout booster that includes creatine and NO. 

I&#8217;ll definitely be posting when I try something, and what results I see!

#### Weight

Oh, and after one day of running, my weight is back down to 113 (it was up around 115/116 late last week). I don&#8217;t care too much about my weight in general, although the Pump and Run has me thinking about it a bit. You weigh in in the morning, clothed including running shoes. Then they round your weight to the nearest 5 lbs, multiply that by .7 and then round that to the nearest 5 pounds. So basically, 

117 (rounds to 115) x.7 = 80.5 (rounds to 80)  
118 (rounds to 120) x.7 = 84 (rounds to 85)

Luckily, my Brooks racers are super light, but I&#8217;ve been banking on benching 80 lbs and I don&#8217;t want any unpleasant surprises on race day!  
So, I am thinking that I may try to really reduce my carbs that week, just to play it safe. I obviously don&#8217;t want to worry about dropping weight to the extent it impacts my strength. I just really don&#8217;t want to have to try to bench any more than I have to!
