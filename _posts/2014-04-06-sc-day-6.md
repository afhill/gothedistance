-a banana  
-Vegan pho and spring rolls. I added sriracha despite the fact it had sugar in it. Bad Andrea 🙁  
-muscat grapes and strawberries  
-coconut water  
&#8211; a couple generous samples of the baked granola I made for breakfasts this week. I started with [this baked granola recipe](http://dairyfreecooking.about.com/od/granolacerealsmuesli/r/veganbakedoatmeal.htm) and then modified it to not have any additional sweeteners (I used seed butter instead of the maple syrup, eliminated the brown sugar and just added more cinnamon, and cloves and nutmeg)
