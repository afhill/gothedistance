Although I dread speed workouts, I know how important they are, in making and measuring progress. Today was my second [Yasso 800](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/11/yasso-800s/) workout. I planned to do the 10 (of the 8-10 reps), but for some reason managed to miscount and only completed 9. 

<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/p9pa.jpg" alt="Royal Dansk Cookies" title="Royal Dansk Cookies" width="160" height="146" class="alignright size-full wp-image-783" /> I took yesterday off completely, and didn&#8217;t get out the door til late afternoon. I wasn&#8217;t exactly primed for the run, having eaten literally an entire tin of cookies in the 24 hrs preceding the run. Well ok, not literally a tin: the contents thereof. 

<!--more-->Another beautiful sunny day in Colorado: I set out in my Boston shirt, shorts and a headband. It was a bit chilly by the end of the run, but overall it wasn&#8217;t too bad. 

The workout was 15min w/u, 8-10x(800m in 3:23, jog for 3:23), 15 min c/d. Again, I used my Garmin so I actually did a half mile rather than 800m. Hey, every little bit helps, right?

R1: 3:09  
R2: 3:08  
R3: 3:14  
R4: 3:15  
R5: 3:14  
R6: 3:13  
R7: 3:16  
R8: 3:17  
R9: 3:23

Average: 3:14

About half the time, I&#8217;d check my watch after the rep was over, and I did notice that the last one was right on my target pace. But I swear I didn&#8217;t use that as an excuse to stop, I legitimately thought I was done!

The workout wasn&#8217;t too bad: I actually had to hold myself back in the first rep, and by the end of it I was just having trouble focusing, it wasn&#8217;t that I was struggling. I think that&#8217;s why I like distance running: I can zone out and just let my body lead me. That doesn&#8217;t work so well when you&#8217;re supposed to be pushing. 

So&#8230; overall I&#8217;m pretty happy. I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;m starting to get a little bored of training, but I guess that just means I&#8217;ll really enjoy my upcoming taper, right?
