So apparently i missed something in the TBT rules.. Its been a week and I havent taken any &#8220;rest&#8221; or &#8220;cheat&#8221; days. I guess I&#8217;m just motivated to see results and don&#8217;t feel the need quite yet to take time off. Between running, lifting and derby, I can&#8217;t really fathom giving myself a whole day off! Ahem.. not that I&#8217;ve been running. I need to get back to that!

Food:  
Scrambled egg whites, tomato, spinach, green onion  
2 [Flax carrot apple Muffins](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/02/flax-carrot-apple-muffins/)  
Pineapple, strawberries post-race  
Banana, almonds  
[Bazi energy shot](http://www.drinkbazi.com/index.aspx)  
Strawberries  
Veggies and guac  
[Chickpea granola bar](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/02/peanut-butter-chickpea-yogurt-breakfast-bars/)  
Hard-boiled egg  
Veggie tempeh, quinoa, steamed carrots

Exercise:  
[Fight for Air Stair climb](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/02/fight-for-air-stair-climb-race-report/)  
2hrs scrimmage, 1hr team practice

Ok, after the stair climb the Melting Pot guys were hanging out, and I&#8217;ll admit I considered a cheat. But it didn&#8217;t seem worth it for a tiny bit of chocolate. Instead, I asked them if I could just have a tray with the fruit since I wouldn&#8217;t eat the rest, and they hooked me up! A tray full of pineapple and strawberries (I&#8217;d expected they&#8217;d give me just one piece and leave off the other stuff). 

Then I headed to scrimmage. Last year I started drinking monster energy drink before bouts (they were a sponsor). I&#8217;m obviously not going to do that, but I still have some Bazi energy shots from when I used to take it daily. I decided to give it a try&#8230; And definitely enjoyed it before skating. Scrimmage went really well: I felt strong despite how much we all had to play. A few times I&#8217;d do back-to-back jams and I had some decent moves despite the 1098 stairs I&#8217;d climbed that morning. Then we had an hour of team practice and ended with a sprint. I still felt strong after all of it, and feeling confident for the weekend!
