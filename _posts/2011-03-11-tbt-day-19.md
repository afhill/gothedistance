Back on the exercise bandwagon like whoa today! I worked on my &#8216;peas&#8217; but didn&#8217;t feel terribly strong. (Peas is in reference to some ref last weekend commenting on my arms and saying they looked like spaghetti with peas tied to them)

#### Exercise

AM:

  * Upright rows (25lbs- 15 9, 20lbs-10 10)

I forgot I redeemed my [discount](http://deals.mamapedia.com/deals/door-to-door-organics) this week (it&#8217;s been a long week). Yum! I got mostly fruit but tried some of the beets right away and got broccoli ready for snacking.
    
    Oh! But the biggest news of the day is that my office is moving, letting us have some flexibility in work hours and/or work from home&#8230; AND we are all getting memberships to [Pura Vida Fitness and Spa](http://puravidaclub.com) &#8211; voted Denver&#8217;s Best Health Club. We&#8217;ll be working right next to it and the thought is that we can head on over during the day. This is seriously like a dream come true. Heck, even the flexible hours and working from home had me excited for midday workouts. I really missed the workout facilities I&#8217;ve had at other jobs, and this place is hella swank. Can&#8217;t wait to check it out!
