Today was such a long day I can&#8217;t be bothered to enter it all on livestrong. I figured I&#8217;d get bored of it ðŸ™‚

Food:  
mango  
Ezekiel cereal with kefir, hemp seeds and wheat germ  
tall nonfat chai  
Mix1 protein smoothie post-race  
Whole foods salad bar  
[Texture tuna sandwich on seven grain](http://parsleyandbailey.com/sandwichmenu.html)  
[Dried apple chips](http://www.barefruitsnacks.com/granny-smith-apple.html) (YUM)  
[gojiberry granola bar](http://www.twomomsintheraw.com/product_details.php?Prod_ID=2)  
Hummus, pita, veggies  
[Whole food energy bar](http://myvega.com/products/whole-food-energy-bar/features-benefits)  
Cottage cheese

Exercise:  
PT exercises  
5k race  
3 hours of light skating as I ran Pick-Up Derby

Today I left the house at 8am and didn&#8217;t get home til 10pm &#8211; I wanted to be sure I was honoring my body and not doing the easy fast-food thing. I basically snacked all day which isn&#8217;t great (as in, I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m getting any good meals in) but at least the snacks themselves were good. I was super impressed when I went to Scott and Crash&#8217;s house and rather than chips and salsa, they put out hummus, pita and veggies. ðŸ™‚

I have to write up a separate race report but it&#8217;s worth noting here that I&#8217;m pretty sure I want to stay eating the way I have been, I think there are some real benefits to reap!
