I went to bed at 9 last night, absolutely spent. I was gross and sweaty and just crawled into my sheets to pass out without so much as a shower. I&#8217;ve been feeling a bit feverish lately, too. I expected to get some shut-eye and be my regular energetic self by morning. 

Nope &#8211; my alarm went off and I still felt like crud. I decided a heavy lifting session wasn&#8217;t a good idea, but maybe I could get an easy run in. I really probably should have checked my heart rate before I even started because I struggled right from the outset. I decided to turn around pretty quickly, only making it a single mile. Rest day!

I truly took a rest day, even used a sick day from work to try to make myself feel better. I actually went to bed really early one night over the weekend too. No bueno! I&#8217;m really happy I got up over 50 miles last week and I&#8217;d like to keep my volume up, but obviously not at the expense of my health. 

I did go in for a massage today (massage envy, where I officially canceled my membership), so that was a nice way to try to feel better. But I just felt slooooow. Walking to the store, I felt like I was casually sauntering. It was weird, but probably good for me. 

Oh! And I looooove [vitamin cottage/natural grocers](http://www.vitamincottage.com/). They only have organic produce, at a reasonable price. Look at these amazing huge beets &#8211; $1.89!! Yeah, I&#8217;ve become THAT person who only buys organic produce unless it&#8217;s absolutely necessary.
