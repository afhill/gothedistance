Weight: 110.6 (I totally don&#8217;t believe my scale)

Saturday was a bad day nutritionally, and I had some bad dreams and woke up with horrible stomach cramps. Coincidence? 

Lifiber with orange juice, iron, adrenal supplement, glucosamine, one-a-day, b-force, salmon oil, hemp seed oil.  
I tried to make oatmeal on the stove instead of microwave, and added greek yogurt. Gross on both counts and i barely ate any.  
Nonfat chai  
Blueberry Yogurt  
Cashews  
Shake and go smoothie  
Cutie  
General tsos chicken, white rice  
A few bites of Cheesecake  
Cake  
Mini cupcake  
2 amaretto sours

Since I can&#8217;t run, I rode my bike for about 10 miles, did shoulder work, arms and crunches. I feel like my arms are getting some good definition. 

Tonight was our roller derby Doll Ball, hence the cake and drinks. I also went out for a friend for dinner and decided to go for chicken just to try to get some greasy meat protein into me. It may be awhile before I do that again ðŸ™‚ at the restaurant they also gave us free dessert so I had to try it!
