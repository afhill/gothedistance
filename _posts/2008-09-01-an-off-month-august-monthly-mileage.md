Ah yes, so it was bound to happen eventually. This month my daily running routine came to an end.

See all that icky black stuff? Those are the days of non-running. If you look at my [mileage spreadsheet](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pgx4qM2eRki4TlC-_e4XeJA), you&#8217;ll notice there are no ugly black marks until this month. And then, wow, I made up for it!

To be fair, this was an incredibly busy month for me. I went back to [Canada for a visit](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/08/travelling-similar-roads/), and also travelled to interview and [secured a new job](http://www.afhill.com/blog/2008/08/30/a-shiny-new-job-title/). I was only in the office for 10 of the 21 work days in August, so perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t feel too bad that I only put partial effort into running as well, running 18 of 31 days.

My weekly average mileage dropped of course, but it&#8217;s still above 30 mpw, so I guess I&#8217;m ok with that. It&#8217;s not the 40 I had as a goal for the year, but I&#8217;m staying healthy and uninjured, so that&#8217;s definitely a good thing!

Overall: 80.34 miles  
Raced: 1 marathon &#8211; 4:04:37

I definitely feel encouraged and eager to get back into running. I really miss having a training plan, and already have something in my sights&#8230;
