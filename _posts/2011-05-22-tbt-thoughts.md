I can&#8217;t believe my 90 day progam is over! But I woke up today and made myself Ezekiel cereal with kefir, hemp and chia seeds and blueberries, then some tea and a smoothie. I used the 90 days to learn how to fuel my body, and I don&#8217;t plan on reverting to my old ways. 

Overall I really enjoyed the program: I&#8217;m always up for a challenge! But I do think I cheated myself a bit by having roughly a month of &#8220;pre-training&#8221; before I started. I feel like I could have seen better results had I not done that. Let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s not like my &#8220;before&#8221; pics are anything to be ashamed of!

Honestly, the pics don&#8217;t really do the results justice, I don&#8217;t think. At least once a week I get complements on my arms and shoulders, where I didn&#8217;t before. Yet I feel like to look at the photos, there isn&#8217;t _that_ significant of a difference.

<br clear="left" /> The one area I wish had developed better, and I plan to focus on next, is my abs. I know they are stronger: I can feel it when I play derby. Yet I still feel like they don&#8217;t show as well as they could. I know a big part of it is genetics but I feel that I could be doing better. For awhile there I wasn&#8217;t doing much ab work, but I&#8217;m going to really try to put more effort into it in the coming weeks. 

I was impressed with my back, and want to keep working on that, and I know I neglected my chest a fair bit. I did a good chest workout yesterday and I feel it today, so I want to be sure I put more time into it. Part of me wasn&#8217;t super excited about working my chest because I don&#8217;t feel you can see the results as much, but now&#8217;s the time for me to think about overall strength and conditioning, not these photos ðŸ™‚

I didn&#8217;t make my (admittedly somewhat arbitrary) 120lb goal, but I&#8217;m back at 117, which is pretty well my standard adult weight (it&#8217;s also what the [nutritional assessment](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/04/tbt-day-44-nutrition-club-adventures/) I got said is my ideal weight). My body fat reading (which I know isn&#8217;t really reliable) is 12.2%. I feel like I can see it in my pictures: I feel I look solid, but it&#8217;s lean muscle. 

All in all, I think this was a great program and I&#8217;m glad I did it. I wish more people would give it a try and see what they can accomplish. It&#8217;s fun to see what you can do when you put your mind (and body?) to it!
