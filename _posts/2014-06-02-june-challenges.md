Apparently &#8220;suns out, guns out&#8221; has made some folks nervous, I came across two June-long challenges to get fit. Of course, I had to take em! One is an abs challenge and one is &#8220;buns, guns and abs&#8221;. There&#8217;s some overlap of the activity but I&#8217;ll just do em both. 

And so that I can remember to go here to look at the daily challenge rather than going to facebook, here&#8217;s the workouts:
