&#8230;I run a pre-race!

Today is the cap city half. I&#8217;m running with a friend who&#8217;s doing her first half. Yesterday I volunteered at the Expo and then went to dinner with a few friends (the gang and a few runners from work). It was exciting to speak to the first-timers. It was fun to answer questions and offer &#8220;words of wisdom&#8221;. Even though I&#8217;m not running this race for time, it&#8217;s just serving to get me soooo excited for next week in Boston. Next week I&#8217;ll be the excited, nervous one wondering, &#8220;should I have done anything different? Am I dressed appropriately? How&#8217;s it all going to be?&#8221;

I remember why I get hooked on these things!!!
