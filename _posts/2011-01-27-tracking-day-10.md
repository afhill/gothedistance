Weight: 110.0

oatmeal, pb, hemp seed, a tiny bit of brewers yeast  
2 bananas  
Yo sushi roll (salmon, tuna, avocado, mango)  
Kihei salad with tofu, spinach, avocado, mango, Ginger, cukes and lite raspberry vinaigrette dressing  
2 oranges  
Greek yogurt with granola and hemp seed  
Craisins.. Funny how my tastes are already changing. Only had a couple and the sugar was too much!

Today I did my PT exercises in the morning, and wii active at night. I also went to acupuncture for the first time. I told her about my knee and hip and she also placed some needles elsewhere. Overall it was relaxing. Odd that I&#8217;ve now had two days of electrical stimulation on my hip. I&#8217;m turning into a real ElectroCutie (new roller derby team)! My knee was a bit sore this evening but I&#8217;m not entirely sure that&#8217;s a bad thing..

Off to use the foam roller, and call it a night!
