Monday: 6.75 run in the morning, Power 30 class (deck squats &#8211; 4&#215;20, burpees 3&#215;10, medicine ball over-unders 4&#215;20, jumping jacks 4&#215;100, Turkish get-ups 3&#215;10) and some abs at lunch

Tuesday: Crossfit WOD (slam balls and hang cleans) in the morning, 9.1 mile workout with the RRBs in the afternoon

Wed: 4 mile morning run. I&#8217;d planned to hit the gym AND get a second run in, but things got a Lil crazy at work and then I just wasn&#8217;t feeling motivated. 

Thursday: Crossfit WOD (rows, kb thrusters, deadlifts, handstand pushups). 9.5 mile run mid-day.

Friday: Gym workout in the morning, mostly upper body, and an easy 2.4 mile run. Had planned for a bit more, but my knee was acting up a bit (I blame the deadlifts) and I knew I was already ahead of my target mileage for the week

Saturday: 9.3 mile run with the RRBs. It was intended to be a 5 mile tempo but I blew up in the third mile. I&#8217;ll pace better the next time we do this course! Then I took an ice bath and did the compression boots and felt amazing!

Sunday: Gym workout, abs and upper body (I worked a lot on my biceps), 12.9 mile run with KJ. Felt really good!

Total miles was just shy of 54. The weather is getting nicer out, which makes getting out for a run SO much more enjoyable!!
