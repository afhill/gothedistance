This month&#8217;s mileage was down a little, 124.21. 

I didn&#8217;t do any races, and I only got in three runs over 10 miles. However, I just got back from a great 12.5 (yes, that was included in the three I just mentioned) and remembered how much I love running in the mornings. I have to get back to that! I also have a few races on the schedule for July, so that should help me stay motivated.
