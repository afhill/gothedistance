We got a bunch of snow last night! So that explains (in part) my headachy and sleepiness last night. Changes in barometric pressure do a number on me. Throat is still sore though..

#### Food

  * quinoa with almond milk, hemp seed and blackberries
  * tea &#8211; today I went with honey rooibos. Yum!
  * smoothie with spinach, carrot, beets, protein powder, chia seeds, apple, blueberries, banana.
  * pb protein bar
  * homemade [butternut squash soup](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/butternut-squash-soup/)
  * hummus and multi-seed crackes
  * a sample of some homemade pumpkin quinoa bars. No good üôÅ
  * amazing meal with almond milk

#### Exercise

Like every other TBTer in Denver, I took today as a rest day! Although I had to do a site launch tonight and it&#8217;s now 4:23am and I&#8217;m tempted to go run just so I can say I did.
