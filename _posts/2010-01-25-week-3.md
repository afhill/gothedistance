This week reality (read: roller derby) set in, and running took a bit of a backseat. 

Mon: off (but that&#8217;s ok; it was the day after a race!)

Tues: Good morning run, 3 miles in 28:31. AvgHR 152, MaxHR 173.

Wed: 1.3 miles at an 8:38 pace before work; AvgHR 152, MaxHR 175; roller derby after work

Thurs: off; had roller derby after work

Fri: off; had a roller derby meeting after work!

Sat: planned to go long with the Boulder Running Company, but my running buddy was recovering from the flu and only wanted to do 6. So we did; at an 8:05 pace! AvgHR 170, MaxHR 181.

Sun: woke up to go to Manitou Springs; felt a bit under the weather. Did the Incline and then was starting to head to Barr Camp, but decided to cut it short. Twisted my ankle heading back, which was scary but not particularly serious. Did a walk/jog back to the car. Probably only did ~7 miles in total.

(A day later, my ankle is still swollen, although it doesn&#8217;t hurt to walk on. I had considered going to roller derby practice last night, but decided not to push it).

So I didn&#8217;t even crest 20 miles this week, which is dramatically lower than my goal of 20 miles on weekends, in addition to weekday miles. At least it&#8217;s not from lack of motivation on my part&#8230; ! 

Weekly mileage: 17.25  
Monthly mileage: 69.95
