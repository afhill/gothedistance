Back on May 17th, I [did the Incline](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/05/i-did-the-incline/), a crazy hike up some 5000 stairs in the mountains. Today I returned for a second attempt.

I gave myself the goal not to rest on the climb, and headed steadily up the stairs. It&#8217;s humbling when your heart rate is wavering at 174 beats per minute, yet your garmin isn&#8217;t even measuring a pace (because you&#8217;re moving so slowly!). I just kept putting one foot in front of the other, however, even chatting a bit with others as I climbed. For some reason I&#8217;d had in my mind that I finished it in 48 minutes last time, so I was surprised when I crested the top in 35:28. As it turned out, I finished it in 39:10 in May. Still, a marked improvement, especially considering I hadn&#8217;t taken a break, either. Interestingly enough, the Garmin measured the distance as .82 last time and only .76 today, but because of the extreme vertical distance covered, I&#8217;m not too concerned. I&#8217;m fairly confident no rails were removed from the track in the past month!

Since the marathon on June 7th, I&#8217;ve only covered a single running mile not in heart rate zone 1. My heart rate was high today, but when I neared the end of the run I felt really strong and really wanted to tear into it. I think I understand now part of the merits of the recovery zone running, and I am eager to see how things will go once I start officially training again. Next weekend is the Barr Mountain Trail Race, and then the next day I will start training for Twin Cities. I&#8217;m looking forward to a formal training plan again, hopefully life will comply and let me do what I need to do!
