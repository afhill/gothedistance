Today I decided to hit the treadmill to get some decent speed up: I have the Steamboat marathon coming up in a couple weeks and have been running almost exclusively on trails, so my pace has been slow. 

The other day I finally got a shuffle so that I don&#8217;t need to use my iPhone to listen to music, and I pulled on my Sauconys after running in either trail shoes or my Newtons for the last few weeks. 

My goal was to run 5 miles at an 8 min pace. I set out and quickly bumped the pace up at bit. Then a bit more. Eventually it got to a point where I was definitely pushing myself, but I kept pushing. I&#8217;ve hovered around the 3:30 mark in the marathon through three races over 3 years, and I know that I need to move out of the comfort zone in training if I want to ever do it on race day.

Overall my time was 37:14 (7:27 pace), average heart rate 171 with a max of 187. Now I&#8217;m off to rehydrate and carb-load for tomorrow&#8217;s big run! The Incline club is doing a double:

> **Waldo/LRR double!** Run the [Ute Pass Trail](http://www.inclineclub.com/maps/upt_lrr_bt.htm) and then head over and do [Waldo Canyon](http://www.inclineclub.com/maps/waldo.htm) &#8211; either way. Next, head up LRR and return via the Barr Trail. 3-4 hours
