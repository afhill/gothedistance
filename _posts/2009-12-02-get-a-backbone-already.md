I have suffered from headaches, neck pain and occasional back pain for quite awhile: notably, I often end up with neck stiffness after running. Over the past 6 months or so, the headaches and neckpain have gotten worse. I&#8217;d resolved to go see a chiropractor, and then last week at the Turkey Trot, they were doing free spinal screenings. I stopped in.

The first thing they had us do at the free screening was stand on two scales, with (ostensibly) our weight equally distributed on each. Interestingly enough, it turns out I actually carry about 10lbs more weight on my left than right side. Also, a quick view showed my hips and shoulders are also out of alignment. The doc in attendance told me briefly about their practice, and when I found out they were located only a few minutes from my work, I agreed to come in for some xrays and a complete screening. They sent me home with several pamphlets of research demonstrating the impact of the spine on basically all parts of the body, physical as well as emotional health. 

I went in to [Denver Tech Chiropractic](http://denvertechchiro.com/) yesterday, and was pretty impressed. One of the brochures was about the two different types of chiropractors: those that relieve symptoms, and those who focus on more complete wellness. These guys are the &#8216;wellness&#8217; ones, which is really more what I was looking for. I don&#8217;t have a specific injury, I want overall to be sure I&#8217;m healthy and strong. 

Dr. Uphill did ax exam, that was pretty interesting. The one place in my neck that has really been hurting lately is related to the sinuses, which have also been really bothering me in recent months (to the point where I got one of those sinus rinse kits last week). Some things he pointed out were amazingly obvious and surprising, considering the fact I&#8217;m very active and in good shape. He made a vertical line through my navel and -where my adam&#8217;s apple would be-, explaining that was my center, and noted that my chin and nose should also be along that line: but they&#8217;re not. Obviously, there is some weird shift or curve that&#8217;s causing my whole FACE to be to the right. Initially he thought my left leg was actually shorter than the right, but it appears it&#8217;s just how my hips are tilted.

Then we took xrays, and I came back today to review. 

Wow.

Again, I&#8217;m in pretty good shape. But to compare my spine to the &#8220;normal&#8221; one, I can see there are a few issues. A few of the vertebrae in my lower back are crooked, and the overall spine has a curve to the right. But up by my neck seemed to concern him the most: some of the vertebrae are totally not level, and on the cross-section xray he pointed out some arthritic crap as a result of a past car accident. He noted that it&#8217;s not that I have as pronounced a forward head posture as he&#8217;d anticipated, but that I have a LOT of tension in my neck, which will ultimately wear things down.

So, home I am now with a cervical pillow, a &#8216;dakota wedge&#8217;, a calendar full of adjustments (4 a week for 6 weeks!), and a ton of exercices. Like, we&#8217;re talking:

  1. 20 pelvic rotations per set, 10 sets a day
  2. 20 Skull posterior translations per set, 6 sets a day
  3. 20 Skull extensions per set, 6 sets a day
  4. 200(!) Prone extensions a day
  5. 25 specific sacral deviation leans per set, 8 sets a day

I had my first adjustment by Dr. Nikitow, who was awarded the World Chiropractic Alliance&#8217;s Chiropractor of the Year for 2008. He impressed me right away, even though adjustments are still a bit scary to me. I got a bit emotional during it, maybe a bit from apprehension but I think also somewhat from relief. He did one muscle test where I was to hold my arm as tightly to my leg as I could, and he was going to try to lift it away. He couldn&#8217;t. Then he simply brushed a spot on my temple, and he was able to easily pull my arm away. He tried another spot, and I was able to hold my arm down. Because of the weakness I showed after his touching my left temple, he resolved that I had a bone out of place. He did a light adjustment, and retried. This time, I did not have the same response, and was able to be strong.  
That sorta stuff is so interesting and amazing to me. It&#8217;s also a bit wonderous to think of the impact even the smallest adjustment or impact can have. 

So&#8230; I have work to do. But I&#8217;m really excited and eager to see how things play out. Part of their introduction is explaining that seeing change takes time: that frequent adjustments, exercises at home and proper nutrition nutrition are all essential to see change. As an athlete, I&#8217;m totally accepting of that, realizing that I need to train my body to be in the shape I want. 

In 6 months, WATCH OUT WORLD!
