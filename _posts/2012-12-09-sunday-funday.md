Turns out you can rhyme a lot of days of the week with funday!

The forecast was pretty miserable for today, so I was unsure what I wanted to do for a Sunday run. James, Eddie et al were looking at Switzerland Trail / Wall St but I&#8217;d heard it was rocky and a bit treacherous in the best of times. Plus, I&#8217;m supposed to be studying like a mad woman this weekend so I really didn&#8217;t need to be doing a run that would add extra travel time before and after. So yesterday I decided to just run locally. Rick, Laura, Fred and I agreed to even SLEEP IN and meet at 8:30. 

As it turned out, the snow/rain/wind never came, and we ended up with a gorgeous day! There wasn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky and there was this big yellow thing in the sky. We each exclaimed at one point or another that it was a perfect day/we live in an amazing place/other random words of gratitude for a runner&#8217;s life in Colorado. 

I actually felt pretty good despite the fact I crested 50 miles a week for the first time since September. (just over 56). Laura and Fred stopped at 10 miles but Rick and I continued on and got in 14.2 at an average 8:27 pace. 

I&#8217;m feeling pretty positive about things right now, though I think I&#8217;ll have to figure out (in advance) how to keep myself from burning out. Just because I feel great now doesn&#8217;t really mean I&#8217;ll stay this motivated, and I need to find that balance of working hard but not overworking. 

Although I&#8217;m going on vacation in March and don&#8217;t plan to run much, a few of the group are looking at the Carlsbad 5000 in early April, it&#8217;s a ridiculously fast and competitive race. I&#8217;d started saying that maybe I&#8217;d just go to cheer on the gang, but now I&#8217;m wondering what I could do on a fast course.. No delusions of placing, of course!! But surely I&#8217;m faster than 19:49 these days&#8230;
