I had a post all written up about how I was going to run Denver this year, prompted by the fact that I had to make a decision tonight to qualify for &#8220;non-late&#8221; entry pricing. You know, tonight, Aug 31st&#8230;

Except it&#8217;s the 1st of September, and the price is now at the level it&#8217;ll stay at til race day. Now I can sit and debate whether or not the race is actually worth $105&#8230; :-/ (even if it is listed by Runners world as one of the &#8220;marathons you should do in &#8217;08&#8221;)
