so after reading about the New York Marathon today, feeling slothlike from not exercicing in forever, and noticing it was [World Run Day](http://runday.com/), I decided to head out for just a bit. Went to Antrim to run around the lake, thinking the path was one of the best surfaces for me. I set out and&#8230;. I jogged. 12 min to circle the 1.2 mile lake. It was slow, but I ran. It was nice to be out, and I concentrated on where the sensations were in my knee. I experimented a bit with speeding up and slowing down to see how it felt. 

I&#8217;m going to ice my knee tonight and see how it feels over the next few days. The difficult part is that it doesn&#8217;t hurt except when I run, so it&#8217;s hard to gauge when I should try again. And for the record, the sensation subsided once I&#8217;d been running for a few minutes. It just feels ..weak.. on the inside of my knee. When I sped up, every once in awhile it would hurt as I landed on that leg, it almost felt as though I were hyper extending it. Interesting..

so yeah, ran 2.4 miles today. Still under 10 for the week, so it&#8217;s still my lowest mileage of the year ðŸ™‚
