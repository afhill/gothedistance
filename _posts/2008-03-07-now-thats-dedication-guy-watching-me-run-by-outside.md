Earlier this week, I finally broke down and ordered yaktrax. On Wednesday I received a UPS delivery notice, and I was walking out the door to run last night when I saw that familiar brown truck. 

Good timing, for we&#8217;re dealing with some great weather conditions here: _Tonight&#8230;Snow. Areas of blowing snow. Snow may be heavy at times after midnight. Visibility one quarter mile or less at times. Additional snow accumulation of 4 to 8 inches. Lows in the lower 20s. North winds 15 to 20 mph with gusts up to 40 mph. Chance of snow 100 percent._

So yes, thank goodness for those darned yaktrax, which served as a motivator to get outside and give em a try.

Notice: I don&#8217;t know that little coils on the bottom of your shoes really help with 4 inches of deep snow.

Still, I slogged out a respectable 2.5 miles.. the streak is still alive!
