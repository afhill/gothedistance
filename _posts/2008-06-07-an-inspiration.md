Today I came across [Alyssa Johnson](http://runalyssa.blogspot.com)&#8216;s blog. Alyssa ran Boston, and she just got into the NYC Marathon via the lottery. What really made Alyssa&#8217;s blog interesting is that she&#8217;s not only blogging about the challenges of being a marathoner, she also has Parkinson&#8217;s Disease. I wasn&#8217;t aware of this when I first started reading, until she mentioned some press coverage she&#8217;d received.  
Marathoning isn&#8217;t easy for anyone, but I am especially in awe of her commitment to running. Evidently physical activity can help with Parkinsons, but as Alyssa says in one of the interviews I watched, marathoning may be a bit more than her doctors would have liked. She ran prior to her diagnosis and I think it&#8217;s just so admirable that she would return to it, and dedicate herself to fundraising, etc.  
I was simply in awe of this woman doing her best to manage her disease and lead a good life&#8230;
