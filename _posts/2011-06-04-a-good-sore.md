Today I woke up and stretched my legs like in the days of early marathon training: they creaked and complained and felt horrible and wonderful at once: the sign I had a good leg workout yesterday! And&#8230; there was more to come! My derby mentee KJ and I had talked about running or skating on Fridays, so today we arranged to meet for a &#8220;short&#8221; run after work. Our run ended up being 5.25miles at an 8:40ish pace, and my legs definitely felt it as soon as we started! I actually was surprised that my average heart rate ended up at 149 (officially, &#8220;recovery pace&#8221;), as I felt I was working a lot harder than that!

But, it worked out nicely, as after our run we went to Double Easy&#8217;s boyfriend&#8217;s birthday bbq (try saying that five times fast), and got to relax in their hot tub. I love that thing, and so did my legs! 

I started off being good at the BBQ, then I gave myself a reprieve and ate some crappy food. But apparently I&#8217;m supposed to be back on the TBT with some other folks, so I guess that made today my cheat day?

#### Food

  * Smoothie. I added peanut butter again. I have been really eating a lot of PB lately..
  * tea
  * peach
  * palak &#8220;paneer&#8221; (with tofu), whole wheat naan
  * apple with peanut butter
  * muscle milk
  * clif bar
  * veggie burger on a not-seemingly-whole wheat bun with guacamole
  * veggie sticks
  * pita chips and hummus
  * *ahem&#8221; a few cookies and a brownie
  * \*ahem\* key lime soda (I brought two beer to the party, didn&#8217;t drink any)

#### Exercise

  * 5.25 mile run
  * a number of pull-ups on the bar in Easy&#8217;s house..a lot of us tried doing different grips. TInY is a master at some one-handed grip!</ul>
