Once again, it never occurs to me it&#8217;s the end of the month until Meredith posts that it is ðŸ™‚

Jan stats:  
daily run resolution: 100%  
monthly miles: 125

4mile race: 3rd female overall  
15mile race: 1st in AG

I&#8217;m still keeping track of my miles at http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pgx4qM2eRki4TlC-_e4XeJA, but I&#8217;ve also started using logyourrun.com, which pulls in the weather info, allows me to capture route, HR and pace information, AND lets me publish it to facebook ðŸ™‚ I haven&#8217;t yet determined if my profile can be shared publicly yet.
