I was cleared to submerge my scar in water this weekend, so I hit the pool with my roommate Yi-Nan this afternoon. 

My PT had told me I could walk in chest-deep water, or to use a pullbuoy if I wanted to swim. Initially I thought I&#8217;d just ease into it and go for the walking, but I was actually too nervous to do so! I hopped around the pool on one leg and didn&#8217;t feel comfortable trying to walk. Strange!

The ones available at the rec center were strange; they were really just two pieces of something resembling styrofoam attached by two ropes. You placed the ropes between your legs so the styrofoam pads were above and below your legs. I wasn&#8217;t even sure how far down my legs to place them&#8230; just trying to figure them out was practically a comedy of errors! But eventually I figured it out and was able to focus on my arm strokes. This worked out fine since the Total Immersion technique focuses moreso on body positioning and gliding than kicking anyway. 

Breathing is still a big problem. Early in the TI lessons they tell you to roll over onto your back to breathe, but even that was difficult for me! 

I also tried some of the beginner lessons of just trying to glide or &#8216;find the sweet spot&#8217; (See below) and it just wasn&#8217;t happening! I tried not to be too frustrated and wondered if the pullbuoy was throwing me off. 



I am thankful for my large lung capacity because when I wasn&#8217;t trying to figure out breathing and just went as far as I could before popping my head up, I could get most of the way across the pool in just two breaths. I tried to focus on body roll and front quadrant swimming, and actually felt pretty strong, even without any kick at all!

I mentioned the technique of body roll and gliding to Yi-Nan and she was curious about the lesser kick. I recommended she try the pullbuoy and afterwards she said balancing was hard, as was breathing. So perhaps the pullbuoy WAS part of the problem! It artificially tried to keep your legs parallel. I&#8217;ll keep hoping, and see what comes on things once I am cleared to kick ðŸ™‚ 

Although my PT told me to stay away from pool running, I think next time I go I&#8217;ll bring my aquajogger belt just to help me with my confidence walking. I did stand on the bottom and do calf raises, but I was just scared to &#8216;put all my weight on one leg&#8217;. 

It&#8217;s hard to think that in just a couple weeks I&#8217;ll be walking again on dry land, given my hesitation today. But I suppose only three weeks ago I was being operated on, and I&#8217;ve made great progress since then! It&#8217;s all a process, right?

Oh.. and it&#8217;s probably just worth mentioning.. I think I overdid it trying out my tri bike yesterday. I woke up this morning with a sore upper back and a REALLY tight IT band/quad on my right side. I massaged and iced it, but it made me nervous. Especially since my PT had warned the angle may be a little aggressive for my knee right now, I&#8217;m going to go back to my old hybrid bike for awhile..
