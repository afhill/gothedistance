So we all know I&#8217;m a big fan of cross-training, AND I told myself I needed to do more short distance races this year..

Increasingly, skaters are starting to participate in races (the Fight for Air Stair Climb, the Bolder Boulder, the Warrior Dash), and some of us are going to be participating in the [Run Denver 5K](http://www.bkbltd.com/RUNDENVER.htm) race series as well!

The five races are:  
Rudolph Ramble &#8211; Dec 5  
Polar Bear Run &#8211; Jan 23  
Super Bowl Run &#8211; Feb 6  
Valentine&#8217;s Day &#8211; Feb 13  
That Dam Run &#8211; March 6

Three of the five are at Washington Park, so that&#8217;ll serve as a good test to see how we&#8217;re improving.
