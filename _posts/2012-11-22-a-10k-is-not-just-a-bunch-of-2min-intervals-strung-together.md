Today I lined up for the Mesa Turkey Trot 10K. I was feeling good, stronger than last year. I felt great as I ran along, the first three miles flew by. But as the race continued, it got harder. This shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise. I pushed a bit, but not too much. I knew last year I tore it open in the last mile, so I bode my time through mile 4 and waited for &#8220;the time&#8221;. 

But things weren&#8217;t easy, and when I got to mile 5, I assessed how I felt. I was hurting, and I didn&#8217;t want to hurt like that for another 1.2 miles. Even though I knew that was less than 10 minutes. 

I stopped and walked. 

Really, Andrea?? This is ridiculous. You can do anything for 10 minutes.. except, I didn&#8217;t want to. I didn&#8217;t care. 

Or do I care too much?

I&#8217;ve always been someone who feels deeply; I have trouble moderating my emotions. I sink deep into pain and sadness (like, oh, right now), but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it in this race. At least a half dozen people passed me as I sauntered down the street. Then I got going again and cruised by some folks. As I entered the park just before mile 6, a spectator told me I was the 14th woman and to go catch the gal right before me. I accelerated and cruised by her, and then slowed again. My drive was gone. She passed me again easily and I slowed even further. Who cares. 

Fred and Steve D from my running group know of my finishing kick, where at the end of every interval, with 15 seconds to go, I&#8217;d come tearing from behind to pass them. Not today. A 10K is not a bunch of short intervals strung together. I jogged it in across the line&#8230; 17 seconds slower than last year. (41:40) I definitely walked more than 17 seconds, so overall I ran faster than last year. Great job, Andrea. Your head beat your legs again. 

I had just started training with the RRBs when I ran the Turkey Trot last year. I&#8217;d been following the &#8220;Run Less, Run Faster&#8221; plan, where you have a speedwork session, a tempo run, and a long run per week. I knew what it felt to run an aggressive pace for 5-6 miles. My body knew how to push when it started to fatigue. Since then, many of my workouts have included shorter, faster intervals. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like short fast intervals. But 20 seconds at a 6 minute pace is NOT preparing me for half marathons, or 10Ks, or 5Ks.

Hence my underperforming, quitting or not even showing up at far too many races this year.

I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m starting to work with a different coach, and hope that his approach will help me with what I&#8217;m lacking. It&#8217;s not speed, I know I can get my speed up. It&#8217;s being able to sustain it, get comfortable with being uncomfortable and keep pushing through it. 

Right now, I feel raw and sad and numb. I don&#8217;t want to feel like this, despite the fact that I like feeling things intensely. I hope it helps move the needle to make things change. Right now my knee jerk reaction is to not to want to race, and even to pull back from my running group again. I am embarrassed. 

Running has long been for me, and I feel a lot more pressure now. Not necessarily from the group as I know my place in the group is among the slowest. Sure, I get frustrated when a friend tries to suggest a pace faster than I think I&#8217;m able, but I am generally quick to tell them I&#8217;m not in a place to run the pace they suggest. The bigger disappointment is when I&#8217;m not able to execute in a race that I SHOULD be able to. And that&#8217;s been most of them this year. 

Platte River Half &#8211; 3 min slower than desired  
Pikes Peak Marathon &#8211; 20 min slower than last year (didnt have a specific goal in mind, but underperformed)  
Denver Half &#8211; DNS  
Columbus Marathon &#8211; DNS  
Home Sweet Home 10K &#8211; DNF

Hmm, looking back on that, it&#8217;s been a pretty crap year for running. And considering it&#8217;s the most training I&#8217;ve done in terms of volume and overall guidance, that&#8217;s a pretty sorry state. I feel like my fitness is good but my racing is really lacking, and it&#8217;s a shame.
