I was just looking at some different plans.. I know I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do the [FIRST plan](http://www.furman.edu/first/2006%20half%20marathon%20training%20program.pdf) because every run is very time-focussed. I enjoy going out and running with my training group and not worrying about sticking to a very specific pace. But I wondered about taking some of the other aspects of the plan.

The FIRST plan is based on three days of running workouts, as well as cross-training. The three key workouts basically include a speed workout, a tempo workout and a long run. I looked at the half marathon plan, and the paces are keyed off your 10K time.

My 10K time is horribly soft. As in, my 10K PR pace= 7:43, my half marathon PR pace = 7:48. So I computed backwards (as I did when working out my training paces the first time I did a Pftiz plan).

According to the FIRST plan, your PHMP (Planned Half Marathon Pace) is 10K pace + 20sec. My goal pace is a 7:24. So the 10K pace I should be working off of is 7:04. 

_Hm, odd that this is almost exactly my 5K PR pace. We&#8217;ll ignore that fact._

So the paces for doing various speed workouts are as follows:

400M &#8212; 6:04pace  
600M &#8212; 6:09pace  
800M &#8212; 6:14pace  
1200M &#8211; 6:17pace  
1600M &#8211; 6:24pace  
2000M &#8211; 6:29pace

Gulp!

As well, short tempo runs should be at 10K pace (7:04) and Mid-tempo runs should be at 7:19.

The next thing I&#8217;ll have to work out if I do try to use these times is that the FIRST plan is an 18 week plan and I am already less than 18 weeks out from the race. Hmmm&#8230;

\***  
I just read an article in CoolRunning that mentioned a 3 day a week marathon plan. Their plan involved the following:

I&#8217;m not sure this isn&#8217;t the marathon version of the plan, and I may be tempted to try to do these speed workouts (although the pace may kill me!) 

If I run with Meredith and Mike on Tuesday, do long runs on Saturdays, I could do these speed workouts on Thurs, and potentially an easy run on Fridays (when I work from home?) Realistically, Tuesdays are probably better for these, as I wouldn&#8217;t be as rushed, but I do like running with others.. hm&#8230;
