I wouldn&#8217;t be able to call myself a Marathoner if I didn&#8217;t have an opinion on the recent announcement by the Boston Athletic Association that they were [changing the qualification times and process for the prestigious Boston Marathon](http://www.baa.org/news-and-press/news-listing/2011/february/boston-athletic-association-announces-new-registration-process.aspx).

For many runners, the &#8220;BQ&#8221; (Boston qualifying time) is a firm goal. Forget Disneyland, many runners cross a finish line with a triumphant &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Boston!&#8221; There is even a &#8220;Last Chance for Boston&#8221; race in Ohio to help runners get a qualifying time. But in the past few years the race has filled up so quickly many runners can&#8217;t get in regardless of their eligibility.

I suppose the question to consider is what the qualifying time really denotes. The New York City Marathon has &#8220;[guaranteed entry](http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/entrantinfo/apply.htm)&#8221; times. If you apply having met their times, you are automatically accepted. For Boston, the times truly just mean that you are eligible to run.

Yesterday&#8217;s announcement was two parts: all qualifying times will be 5 minutes faster per age group. I&#8217;ve long felt this was needed, especially in the female age groups. I actually didn&#8217;t even read the announcement when I first saw the headline, and it was only later when I learned of the more controversial part of the announcement.

There will now be rolling enrollment based on qualifying time. On the first day, people whose time is 20 minutes faster than their qualifying time will be allowed to register. A few days later, those whose times are 10 times faster will be able to register. A few days later, those whose time is 5 minutes faster can register. After the first week, provided there is still room, anyone with a BQ can apply. There will be a week of open application (not registration) and then the field will be filled based on qualification time. If at the end of the week there are still openings, further applicants will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.

The model of allowing people to apply but not register right away reminded me of NYCM, but the bulk of NYCM is done by lottery. From a PR perspective, this type of deferred entry seems to be a big win. You potentially touch many more folks than can possibly participate, and have two spikes of interest: when people apply and when they&#8217;re accepted (or not). Not to mention the process is a little more forgiving if people have a window to get their entry in. I understand that from the coordinator&#8217;s perspective. But what I absolutely hope the B.A.A. doesn&#8217;t adopt from NYCM is the non-refundable application fee. That&#8217;s the part I think is a total scam. They accept applications from something like 100,000 people, but only select 40,000 to run. Yet all 100,000 pay an $11 service fee. But at least in NY everyone in the lottery has an equal chance to get in..

I&#8217;m actually not adverse to the overall approach to give priority registration to faster runners. We see it in other events: take the Kona Ironman World Championships, where I believe your age group place at qualifiers is used. It&#8217;s just a departure from the perception that a BQ is a guarantee. As it is, the race has filled up and people have been closed out.

Ultimately, the week of open application will really help the B.A.A. understand how many folks are eligible and interested in running. Right now they don&#8217;t have a real way to know, as people can&#8217;t apply after the race is full. This is actually great data for them to understand how the qualifying times should be adjusted (hint: I still suspect the womens time is soft compared to the men).

Yes, it is the oldest annual marathon-distance race. But I do believe for more participants, it&#8217;s the fact it requires a qualifying time that makes it so esteemed. As more people are able to meet the qualifying time, doesn&#8217;t that detract some from the achievement? 

If in the first year, the B.A.A. finds they still manage to fill up the first day with folks who all ran at least 20 minutes faster than their qualifying time, then that&#8217;s some nice clear direction that the qualifying times are way too low. After they figure that out, will they still need staggered registration? Maybe, maybe not. But now it really gives runners a few additional goals to strive for. I&#8217;ll be honest, I had a 3:40 goal for my first marathon, and really floundered a bit after that because there wasn&#8217;t much incentive to hit another specific plateau. if I know 5, 10 and 20 minutes help me register sooner, that may help me set my sights higher.

I&#8217;ll be interested to see how the registration times pan out when this goes into effect.
