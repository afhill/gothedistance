Today I met with the running group in Boulder and we did 1k repeats on the road. There was a slight downhill so we were to do HMP on the up and 10k pace on the downs. 

So, I know I just ran a half-marathon a few weeks ago, but if I ran that pace with this group, I&#8217;d lose them immediately. So I do a balance of &#8220;at least keep up&#8221; and &#8220;push myself a bit&#8221;. I suppose I&#8217;d be better off trying to track at my desired race pace than my existing best. 

So, to be more specific about today:  
I was in the slow group &#8211; I didn&#8217;t time my first &#8220;up&#8221; but the other two were 6:53 and 6:51. For reference, my actual half-marathon PR set only a few weeks ago is 7:09. 

Then on the &#8220;downs&#8221; &#8211; 10K pace &#8211; I did 6:32, 6:11, 6:13. My 10K PR (set this Spring) is a 7:18 pace, so obviously I know that&#8217;s off. Oddly enough I showed a lot stronger on the downs than some of the women who beat me on the ups. It&#8217;s almost as though I have gears: this speed felt ok, even as the slower pace on the slight uphill was more effort. 

I&#8217;ve always been good at recovery, and I was one of the leaders of the pack in the cooldown job. I definitely felt I could have run more. Faster? I don&#8217;t know about that. But these paces don&#8217;t seem too out of control or unsustainable. I just want to be sure I&#8217;m doing the workouts for the purpose they&#8217;re intended. If a workout is for LT, I want it to help with that, not pure strength. 

It&#8217;s so fun to feel excited about training again, and seeing what comes of it!
