Well.. Running Movie Mondays, but the other has a nicer ring to it. My friend KJ is getting ready for her first Boston marathon, and we&#8217;ve made Monday nights (her rest day) into motivational days. I go over to her house, we cook and then watch a running movie. They&#8217;ve been super fun, low-key evenings and I really enjoy them. Hope we keep it up after her race!
