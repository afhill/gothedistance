What are those little letters in the brackets, you ask? Well, I started reading &#8220;[The Eat-Clean Diet Recharged](http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Clean-Diet-Recharged-Lasting-Better/dp/1552100677)&#8221; and she clearly calls out four categories of food: Protein, Comple Carbs, Fresh Produce and Healthy Fats. You should apparently have:  
6 servings of lean protein a day  
2-4 servings of complex carbs  
4-6 servings of fresh produce  
2-3 servings of healthy fats  
And in every meal, you should combine a lean protein with a complex carb.

There are some bonus foods like beans, quinoa, and chickpeas that are complex carbs that can count as a protein source, and nut butters that can count as protein and healthy fats. 

Again, I was just curious to see how my food intake falls into those categories. To be fair, I&#8217;m pretty sure the few spinach leaves and tomato in my pita pocket don&#8217;t really count a a full serving, but at least I&#8217;m getting a good variety through the day. 

This morning I ran outside, a fantastic quick three miles. I didn&#8217;t check my watch at all, and threw in some sprints to really push myself. I was pretty darned surprised to make it back to the house and find out my pace was 7:30! It&#8217;s so amazing how much speed I seem to have in these ole legs! 

After work I met with the personal trainer at Better Bodies. I&#8217;m sorry to say I was pretty disappointed. It could definitely be my own fault: I don&#8217;t really have a firm goal like &#8220;I want to add two inches to my biceps&#8221; (that would be crazy!) or &#8220;I want to lose weight&#8221;. So, we did some squats and lunges and a bit of abs. I think I was spoiled by Frida going to see him last week, because she&#8217;d already told me about some killer ab exercise he threw out, and the idea of doing certain body parts once a week. He did test my body fat: he guessed 15-16% and it came out at 16.2. We chatted a bit and really it became clear that I really just need to figure out what my goal is so I can make a plan (duh). Otherwise, it&#8217;ll be like my other times at the gym where I don&#8217;t see progress because I don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;m progressing towards.
