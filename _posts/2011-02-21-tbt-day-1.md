I&#8217;ve been tracking for awhile, but now I have rules to live up to! 

I traveled today, probably not the best day to start a program. Thankfully, I think I weathered it ok-

Food:  
Mango  
decaf Green tea  
Ezekiel cereal with kefir, hemp seed, wheat germ and strawberries  
Tokyo Joe&#8217;s Boulder veggie bowl  
Einstein bros &#8211; veg out sandwich on a Whole wheat bagel, no cream cheese :(, add avocado  
peanuts  
fruit cup  
two moms in the raw gojiberry granola  
dried apricots

Today I did my legs at the gym:  
[hack squats](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/hack-squat)  
[leg press](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/leg-press)  
[leg extensions](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/leg-extensions)  
[lying hamstring curls](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/lying-leg-curls)  
glute kickbacks  
one leg lunges  
[standing calf raises](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/standing-calf-raises)  
[donkey calf raises](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/donkey-calf-raises)

When I do leg curls, I feel little snaps in my hamstrings. It&#8217;s not terribly comfortable, so I don&#8217;t like doing them. However, I&#8217;m going to push myself to work through the discomfort. I&#8217;ve made huge strides in my overall flexibility and I know I can work through this too.
