Today was my first day back running after the Houston marathon. I was good and waited the whole 9 days as my coach advised. I was raring to go! Our planned workout was similar to my [first workout with the group](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/11/restarting-my-running/), starting with hills and then doing some longer repeats. 

warmup, strides, 5x45sec hills, 3&#215;4:00 at 10K pace, 4x75sec at 5K pace, 5min at HMP, cooldown.

I received special instruction to do a partial workout, which was not to do the 5K pace bit. 

We started out, and I was at the front of the pack as we warmed up, so happy to be running! We hit the hills and I was the first one hammering up the incline! At the end of it, Darren said that I should feel free to take it easy. I laughed and said my legs just felt fresh, but I told him I&#8217;d ease off. For the rest, I lined up at the back, and another guy in the group (a trainer for the Striders) told me to tag along with him. He said he ran 3:09 in Boston, so we were roughly equivalent. Um, looking at my paces, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily say these were &#8220;easy&#8221; paces for hills (30ft incline over .12miles)&#8230; 5:34, 6:21, 5:42, 5:57, 5:51 (and my heart rate never crested 184)

Next we were to do 3&#215;4:00 at 10K pace. I told myself to feel free to relax, go around 7mm. But alas, it just felt so good to run! 6:48, 6:45, 6:32.

Then came the 4x75sec at 5K pace. I KNEW to truly take it easy for this and just chugged along fast enough not to be left behind. Yet surprisingly, I found that my easy pace was still pretty respectable: 7:08, 6:52, 7:16, 6:43. 

For the last five minutes, we were to head out &#8220;below threshold&#8221; for the first 2.5 minutes, then turn around and really push it for the last 2.5. I was obviously better recovered than everyone else, and was eager to finish strong. We started, and my coach called out that I should relax (sense a theme here?). He said &#8220;I know you feel good now, but we want to be sure you feel good in 3-4 weeks&#8221;. So I cut my speed.. until we turned around and then I pushed it a bit harder even as we had a nice incline to go up. As we neared the end of the workout, I couldn&#8217;t help myself and really pushed. It felt great! This also came in at a 6:45 pace: apparently my body likes that speed. \*COUGH-13.1milesofthatwouldbe1:28-COUGH\*

In all we got in 9.5, pretty good for my first outing back! My energy was right there and my legs didn&#8217;t seem to have any sort of residual soreness. And of course, my confidence is sky-high. So excited about running! 

9.5 miles in 1:20, average HR 163, max HR 187.
