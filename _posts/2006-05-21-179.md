Blendon Woods 5K results &#8211; 1st in my age group, 4th woman to finish, 41st overall. They gave me a 23:17 finish time &#8211; it was gun time, so I know I was actually faster than that ðŸ˜‰

Today I went to the gym for an hour and a half, then met Helen to run. The original plan was 15, but my knee started to tighten up a bit, so when we passed by the lake at Antrim after 8, I stopped for some water, then decided I didn&#8217;t want to keep going at that pace so I did a lap around the lake on my own for a total of roughly 9 miles today. For the just under 8 miles we did, I ended up with the following mile splits: 8:01, 8:13, 8:13, 8:31,8:29 and then 9:19 for the 1.2 around the lake. I felt fine after I stretched some, and actually considered going out again later, but never managed to get to it. Still felt great to be out there though, today was a good healthy day!
