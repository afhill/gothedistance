Typical. Poor nutrition = poor sleep and a desire to continue to eat poorly. 

I got up and hit the gym before my flight to the East Coast. I&#8217;ll be away from a gym for a few days so I wanted to get a good workout in. I took Superpump again and I don&#8217;t know if I truly already did build up a tolerance or if the fact I ate first changed things, but I didn&#8217;t feel the same intensity as Friday. My arms do feel &#8220;fuller&#8221; as I lift, but I don&#8217;t know that I feel like it lasts.  
I was in a grumpy &#8220;feel sorry for myself&#8221; state, food-wise. At the airport I wanted nachos, not the salad I ended up with. My fit of defiance was to have the goat cheese it came with, a wheat bun that likely wasn&#8217;t whole wheat, AND the honey peanuts on the plane. Not the best, but it could have been worse. Although I ate before the flight, I was really hungry after. Thankfully I&#8217;d packed some snacks.
