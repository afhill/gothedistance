The last Thursday of every month is <a href="http://denverrollerdolls.org" rel="nofollow">Roller Derby Test-ups</a>, where novice skaters are invited to test-up to be eligible to participate in Wednesday scrimmages or actual bouts. Last month I [tested up to A- status](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/04/ready-to-rumble/). I was invited back this month to try to make it up to A status. This would render me eligible to participate in our June 26th bout at the Denver Coliseum. 

As you may infer from the blog post title, I tested up to A-level and am now eligible to play in bouts! To prepare myself, yesterday I purchased some new pads: <a href="http://www.prodesigned.com/" rel="nofollow">Pro-Designed</a> pads are generally considered the premier pads for derby girls. They also do custom sizing, so I took measurements of my biceps, forearms, thigh and calves, and also provided my height and weight. Based on my measurements, &#8220;Wild Bill&#8221; set me up with the Mini P.D. knee pads and the Mini Elbow pads. (Many of the girls on the league had said they went with the mini pads, despite the fact they are &#8216;suitable for those 12 and under&#8217;)

(Although the first time I wore the shorts, I still managed to cultivate a pretty good bruise on my leg, just below the line of the shorts&#8230;)
