The [Bolder Boulder](http://www.bolderboulder.com) has a [pretty remarkable chart](http://media.bolderboulder.com/Qual%20Chart%202012.pdf) for placing athletes into starting waves. They allow for pretty well any distance from 2 miles to 50 kilometers. Are there different distances that may seem &#8220;easier&#8221; to earn a spot in a faster corral? Based on my results, they seem pretty well dead on. 

As it stands now, I&#8217;ll be registering for the AB corral; the 3rd overall. Not too shabby. But what would it take for me to get into the AA corral with some of the races I&#8217;ve run this year?

Yup, that&#8217;s four race distances and four times that place me squarely in the AB corral. I suppose at least I&#8217;m consistent! It&#8217;s been frustrating to set each race goal at that next level and not see it materialize (the 5K was the roughest.. I still can&#8217;t help but wonder what would have happened had their been a timing mat at the starting line..), but at least I can see that my race efforts seem to be consistent? Hopefully as time goes on I can push these all a little further.

I&#8217;d debating making one last ditch effort and trying to pull off a qualification on the treadmill (12:22 for 2 Miles), but I think I&#8217;ll just accept that this is where I&#8217;m meant to start..
