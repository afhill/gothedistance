Today was a great day exercise-wise. I got up and ran 6.5 miles, then Yi-nan and I took our bikes to the CU Rec Center and swam for about a half hour. I&#8217;ve forgotten a lot :-/ The rec center was GORGEOUS! I need to take advantage of it for the time I&#8221;m still a student. The only other times I&#8217;ve been there there was massive construction and I didnt see what all they had. 

&#8211; Kale smoothie (kale, almond milk, frozen berries, vega sports protein, maca powder, turmeric, coconut water)  
&#8211; quinoa and [zuke citrus and ginger kraut](http://ozuke.com/product/)  
&#8211; raw veggies and hummus  
&#8211; a few pieces of polenta-encrusted artichoke hearts in a lemon caper sauce  
&#8211; three sisters salad at watercourse (lettuce, black beans, tomato, corn, peanuts)  
&#8211; tea
