After a few days of hobbling around, I finally acquiesced and went in to see Richey Hanson at [High Altitude Spine and Sport](http://highaltitudesportsrehab.com/). It took me a few days to be willing to go as I knew that rest was likely top of the list and I wanted to give that a try before submitting to expensive tests, etc. 

This is NO reflection on Richey, by the way. But when I tore my PCL a few years ago, it took several doctors visits and a $550 MRI to tell me that I just needed to rest. In this case, particularly since I hadn&#8217;t experienced any obvious trauma, I wanted to give rest and self-care a try first. 

So I rested, iced and compressed. I did my best to stay off it, although I did go to the gym once and did some non-impact exercice (stair-climbing and biking). I also tried some topical anti-inflammatories, including this intense &#8220;Heat and Ice&#8221; topical that made my knee tingle and burn all at once. 

So, finally I go in to see Richey. He&#8217;s fairly sure I irritated my popliteus muscle but likely not to the point of a tear. 

I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the popliteus muscle before he called it out, so now I&#8217;ve done some research:

> The popliteus muscle is a tiny muscle situated in the back of the knee joint, it assists with internal or medial rotation of the tibia and also helps unlock the knee when a runner initiates knee flexion, or bends the knee from a fully extended position.
> 
> This poor little muscle is at risk to over use injuries, and injuries that are causes by muscular imbalances around the knee, also if the knee is excessively hyper extended

Its location at the back of the knee explains why the initial pain reminded me of when I tore my PCL. I was unclear why I was now getting pain up at the lower part of my quad/top inside of the knee, and apparently the popliteus refers pain there. Who knew! 

So &#8211; as I suspected, Richey recommended a week off running. He also taped me up and told me to do much of what I was already doing. Paging Dr. Hill!

Except.. for two things. He said to be careful not to do any sort of deep lunges or to use the elliptical. Not that that&#8217;s a big deal b/c I don&#8217;t really like the elliptical, but I wouldn&#8217;t have though that was a bad thing. AND, he said to be careful with heat, as it could further aggravate the lil muscle. Whoops! Here I&#8217;d thought I was helping things along with this topical thing, but it turns out that could have been part of why it wasn&#8217;t seeming to get any better. 

Sure enough, it&#8217;s been about 16 hours since I saw him, and I do feel like it&#8217;s getting better!

I&#8217;m still not sure what this means for me, race-wise. I am signed up for the Bolder Boulder 10K next Monday. Richey told me to take a week off, but I&#8217;m not sure if 10K as my first run back is a smart idea. He certainly didn&#8217;t rule it out, but I want to be smart about this. I&#8217;m planning a trail half marathon in South Dakota the following week and certainly want to be feeling better for that!

The good thing about these little setbacks is that with each one I feel more confident that that&#8217;s all it is &#8211; a little setback &#8211; and I will be back stronger than ever once I get through it. I&#8217;m not entirely sure what caused this irritation: I had a high mileage week the week before, started doing some trail running, and did some rock climbing &#8211; a combination of any of that may have been a factor. Hopefully I&#8217;ll come out of this stronger and smarter!
