They say it takes three weeks for something to become a habit, and I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m there. 

I was tired and a bit sore this morning after all my physical activity yesterday, but it was my day to go for a run! I did two miles in just over 17min, which would have been completely respectable anytime. When I got back home, I ate a healthy breakfast (Ezekiel cereal, Greek yogurt, hemp seed) and steamed some carrots to bring for lunch.  
I enjoyed snacks through the day: some fruit and almonds. I had two good meals: the last of my garbanzo stew with brown rice, and tuna on a whole wheat pitette. (oh, and lentil chips and green pea guac). I did treat myself to a tall non-fat starbucks chai. I&#8217;m generally a grande girl but this was an attempt to satisfy that craving. 

After work I wanted to swing by the gym, but I didn&#8217;t have time before an evening meeting. (edamame and chef salad with the creamiest &#8220;vinaigrette&#8221; dressing I&#8217;ve ever seen!) Instead I hammered out my pt exercises. They&#8217;re fine, but I have a lot of energy these days and really wanted a good workout. I have pt in the morning tomorrow and then imagine I&#8217;ll hit up bootcamp again after work. 

On Sunday at Whole Foods i told two friends about the merits of hemp seed, and both bought some. I was really pleased today when both reported they really enjoyed it and were going to adopt it into their diet ðŸ™‚ I think it&#8217;s a great protein source and I&#8217;m excited for others to see so as well.
