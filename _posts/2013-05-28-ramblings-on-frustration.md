Yesterday when my knee kept bothering me, I got really frustrated and annoyed. This isn&#8217;t really directed at anyone, it&#8217;s just my natural response to things not being the way I want them.  
I was wondering today if there is a more productive response. Frustration doesn&#8217;t really get me anywhere, but I suppose it is better than just being sad?

Sadness may be wrapped up in hopelessness, which isn&#8217;t going to get you anywhere. But it seems like frustration is a blocking-up point: you hit a wall. So thinking directly of my knee itself: frustration is the locking up &#8211; the point where one moment you&#8217;re moving and the next, you&#8217;re not.

Although this probably doesn&#8217;t actually happen, one could imagine that frustration is an inflammatory response. You flare up, increasing friction and ultimately slowing or stopping any sort of forward momentum. Consider acceptance. No friction &#8211; you can continue moving (regardless if the direction is &#8216;right&#8217; or the speed is the ideal at which you want to advance). 

We all know it&#8217;s easier to steer a bicycle when it&#8217;s rolling &#8211; so perhaps too with other types of locomotion. Being stuck means being stuck, and in the strictest sense it&#8217;s impossible to change direction if you&#8217;re not moving at all.

Ok, enough with the words &#8211; can we see this play out? Just accept how things are and course-correct as best I can? Don&#8217;t see it as an insurmountable barrier, but rather feel that there is always some forward progress?
