This morning I met [Melissa](http://itsamonkey.blogspot.com) for a bike ride. I&#8217;d been a bit concerned about what to wear and bring. I had on my Canada shirt (with the pocket in the back, because as I told Melissa, you need to have a pocket on the back of your shirt to cycle), and padded shorts beneath some longer pants. I didn&#8217;t have riding gloves, although I think I may invest in some ðŸ™‚ I carried along my cell, my car keys and a debit card, and had gatorade with me. In retrospect, I didn&#8217;t have ID, which would have been a good idea.  
We set out north, and rode.. and rode&#8230; and rode. Initially Melissa had suggested a half hour out, but as we got close to that, we decided to keep going. I felt good, despite some minor challenges with opening my bottle and getting it resituated while riding.  
We ended up making it all the way to Worthington-Galena Rd before turning back. It was an absolutely gorgeous day, and we managed to hit 28mph heading down a short hill. Fun! Overall distance from Melissa&#8217;s was [just over 21 miles](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=1842012), and I had a bit more to make it to and from her place.

I admit, I&#8217;m an endorphin junkie. I got home, feeling envigorated, and changed my shoes and headed back out the door. As we had ridden past the Park of Roses, I had wondered what was in bloom, so I drove back there to run. 

I&#8217;ve heard my friends talk about how hard it can be to run after riding, and now I understand. Wow, I felt sluggish! One of my calves felt &#8220;blocked&#8221; (for lack of a better word), but it loosened up pretty quickly. I felt uncoordinated at first, and really during the run I kept feeling like I was working harder than I should have been. In reality, I was doing a decent clip (5 mile run: 10:07, 9:09, 8:42, 8:44, 8:15) but it never felt &#8220;easy&#8221;.

I was composing this post in my head as I ran, and I came up with the analogy of drinking. They say &#8220;beer before liquor, get sicker quicker&#8221;. I&#8217;ve always assumed this was because your body gets used to the lower alcohol content. It can manage it. Then if you switch to something stronger, it is a jolt to the system and it can&#8217;t process it effectively. 

During the 21 mile bike ride, my average heart rate was 135, with a max of 173. During my 5 mile run, I averaged 161, with a max of 179. I was working much harder, after my body had become accustomed to the lower exertion. Not to mention the pounding&#8230; so the run felt harder than it could have (although a 9mm average is still a decent run).

I felt good and strong at the end of the run, although I had no desire to run more ðŸ™‚ I have a bit of a sore spot on the front of one of my toes I&#8217;ll have to keep an eye on. We&#8217;ll see how I feel tomorrow, as I start another week leading up to a marathon.. we&#8217;ll hope today&#8217;s big workout day makes me stronger!!
