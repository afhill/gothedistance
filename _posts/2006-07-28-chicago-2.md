I haven&#8217;t been running much lately. When I have, my knees have hurt, and I&#8217;ve gotten discouraged. It sucks! I had such great hopes for this fall, but with every passing week, I feel like I am getting more and more behind.

Training for Chicago officially starts on Monday. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll go to FrontRunner and pick myself up a new pair of shoes (I&#8217;m surmising that has to do with my pain post-running), and get my head into the game. I just surfed to the chicago marathon site, and checked out the map of the course, and I felt a wee bit of excitement welling up. Spending over three hours on your feet, keeping yourself entertained, hydrated, safe and mentally &#8220;with it&#8221;. What a challenge, what fun!

Time to buckle down!
