I went to bed before 10 last night, just feeling drained and icky. Woke up this morning and did NOT feel like going to training. But I knew I wouldn&#8217;t have any other time to make it up, and I was scheduled to meet Jay afterwards to look at my goals for 2013. So I rolled out of bed at 6:05 for our 6:30 training session..  
And for some reason, those days when I feel crappy always end up the best! We were set to do two sets (with two parts to each set) and get faster with each set. I actually got faster with each part &#8211; 6:52mm, 6:46mm, 6:45mm, 6:28mm. I ran with Rick and Cheri the first set, then we spread out a bit for the second with me chasing Rick down. Overall the paces were great, I&#8217;d been planning to do around 6:51 and 6:4 for the two sets. In all, ran 8.1 miles in just over an hour.  
Then we did our general strength and mobility work, and then I met Jay to discuss 2013. He asked what would be realistic mileage for me &#8211; we decided 45-55 is safe and anything higher would be a new stimulus. He&#8217;s good with my focusing on halfs with the goal to break that silly 1:30 barrier. He said the time between RnRAZ and RnRNO was good, and he&#8217;s already made suggestions as to how I can incorporate some trail running as part of my long runs, especially leading up to Pikes Peak.  
Excited for 2013! 

oh! And really on accident I figured out how to switch screens on my Garmin 410. I&#8217;d been pretty disappointed with my new watch and had given it one week to redeem itself before I returned it. With my discovery, I&#8217;m a lot more pleased with it. I actually really liked using it for lap pace on my run today.
