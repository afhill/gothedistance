The other week I went to [Pura Vida](http://www.puravidaclub.com) for my complementary training session. You know, the one gyms offer so that you&#8217;ll sign up for training. I was convinced I didn&#8217;t need someone to show me how to use machines, but I went anyway to see if I could pick up any tips. 

I met Rebeccah at 6am on a Monday (yikes!) and we got along well. I liked her thoughtful comments on the source of power and strength. Before I even had told her about my little muscle idiosyncracies and past injuries, she said her focus is on fixing imbalances, even down to the slightest foot position, etc. We ran through some different exercises, and at one point I mentioned my weird knee seeming to collapse thing. She watched me squat and immediately just said &#8220;well, that&#8217;s because of the angle of your femur&#8221;. It was just said completely matter-of-factly, and it was like the explanation for various issues I&#8217;ve had. Just knowing that seemed to open my eyes as to why my leg muscles look so uneven, etc. And recognizing that is now a door to figuring out how to account for that in my performance.

I really enjoyed the session, despite the fact I didn&#8217;t want to. The gym also offers discounted rates for an initial 6-session program for new members. So&#8230; I went for it. I&#8217;m so conflicted because I already spend a lot of time and money on fitness, but at the same time I&#8217;m excited to see what I can get out of this. Let&#8217;s face it, I&#8217;m pretty self-taught in all I do. I enjoyed physical therapy, but that was really focusing on a specific issue and rehabilitation. I&#8217;m eager to see how this will work out, how I can continue to get stronger for all the sport I do. 

Here&#8217;s her bio: 

> Rebeccah is from Sao Paulo, Brasil and joins the Personal Training team as a Master Trainer with a BS in Exercise Physiology/ Exercise Science and is certified through NSCA, CSCS (Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist) and NSCA, CPT (Certified Personal Trainer) certifications. Through an internship with NSCA, Rebeccah established a program with the USA Army Fort Carson Combatives Team and assisted in coaching US Army World Class Athlete Program Judo, Taekwondo, and Boxing athletes. She also served as an in-house strength and conditioning coach for fighters at Rough House, MMA.  
> &#8220;The heart of my training is teaching the body to be resistant to the forces set upon it and stable throughout any movement. With proper biomechanics, then, the body is able to correctly and efficiently move, produce power, and develop gains in conditioning, strength, agility, speed and control. I teach people to move in the right way, I don&#8217;t just make them move. In this way, athletes and fighters become more resilient and less injury prone, they are able to produce power in a very efficient way, being less tired and more effective in competition. Those who are interested in bettering their conditioning will notice improvements in all aspects of their fitness. Through my program, they too, will be able to overcome issues such as lower back pain.&#8221;
