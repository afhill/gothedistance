I went to [Dr. Vidal](http://www.denverortho.com/physician_vidal.shtml) today to figure this hip thing out. The diagnosis was hip bursitis, caused by a too-tight IT band on the left side. She suspects that my leg trauma has left some scar tissue that makes the IT Band on that side tighter than normal. 

So, I have anti-inflammatories and am supposed to go to PT twice a week, and not aggravate it. That means no running üôÅ She said if it doesn&#8217;t hurt to skate, I can still do that. But I should consider padded shorts. I&#8217;m nervous because we have a tournament coming up in 6 weeks.. 

I&#8217;ll admit it, the no running made me realllly sad. But, I&#8217;m trying to see the silver lining: I&#8217;ve known I have muscle imbalances and so now I have the time to devote to strengthening and stretching. AND! I just remembered I bought a 20-class pass to [Davis Fitness Bootcamp](http://www.denverfitnesstrainingcamp.com/) but haven&#8217;t had the time to use it yet. Now&#8217;s the time!
