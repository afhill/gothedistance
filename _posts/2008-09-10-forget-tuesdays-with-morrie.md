I have Wednesdays with Meredith!

The Pfitzinger Advanced Marathon plans call for a mid-week run of 10-12 miles. When we were following that plan, Meredith and I would often meet to do the runs together. We haven&#8217;t done a Wednesday run together since before Boston, but today I tagged along for one of her interval workouts. 

15 min. warmup  
3 x (3 min fast, 3 min recovery + 2 min fast, 2 min recovery + 1 min fast, 1 min recovery)  
19 min. cooldown  
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  
1hr 10 min workout

I&#8217;ll admit, I showed up today not really knowing what all we were doing. I think Meredith was amused when I kept asking &#8220;we have to do WHAT? for HOW LONG?&#8221; When it comes down to it, however, intervals make workouts seem much more manageable to me. My stomach would get a bit of a cramp during the hard parts, but I knew I didn&#8217;t have to run hard for long.  
By the time we hit the 3rd rep, I was in a zone. It&#8217;s hard to explain: it&#8217;s as though I felt all my insides bouncing as I ran. But I felt strong, definitely better than I expected!

Here are the &#8220;hard parts&#8221; of the workout&#8230;

After each of the hard segments, there was an equal amount of time for &#8220;recovery&#8221;. 

Overall pace for the run was 8:51mm, with an average heart rate of 157 and a max of 183.

Wow, we hit some good sprints there. Sure, it wasn&#8217;t sustained for long, but it felt good to get that sort of leg turnover. 

Good luck to Meredith at [Reach the Beach](http://www.rtbrelay.com) this weekend!
