Last year as I started to eat clean, I became an expert ingredient-watcher. I shifted from white flour to whole wheat, and tried alternative grains like spelt and quinoa. 

Then in March, I [took a food sensitivity test](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/03/my-body-wants-me-to-be-paleo/) that flagged gluten, whole wheat and spelt as items I was sensitive to. I cut them out completely and was amazed at how much better I felt. It was like a light-bulb moment! I&#8217;d long had stomach cramps after eating, and just assumed that was what digestion was like. But since removing gluten from my diet, I don&#8217;t have to squirm uncomfortably for hours after a meal.

I &#8220;borrowed it&#8221; the last time I saw her and devoured it cover-to-cover. I had been a little worried it would be a little sensationalist, but it was actually fascinating. The book explains how the wheat we eat now is a distant relation to the grain our ancestors ate years ago, and is now a significantly more genetically complicated entity. His discussion of the impact of gluten-containing foods on blood sugar is aligned with what I&#8217;ve read elsewhere, and I welcomed his observation that gluten-free alternatives are often no better when it comes to elevating blood sugar. 

The author claims that wheat effects us on many levels, including our personality and brain function. Supposedly the cravings that many of us have for carbohydrates (wheat in particular) can be alleviated by opiate-blocking drugs. 

The author also mentions some less-serious side effects to gluten (and dairy) consumption, including acne. He claims that in cultures where gluten and dairy are not consumed, individuals do not have the skin problems we have in Western cultures. Fascinating! 

If I had not already made the decision to cut gluten-containing foods from my diet, this book would have convinced me. In fact, I&#8217;ve been meaning to ask my Mom how she can still eat sandwiches and serve them at home! While my own GI issues helped me with my decision, there is enough information in this book to prompt me to feel that gluten-containing foods are best omitted from the majority of diets. 

I&#8217;m fortunate that I don&#8217;t have a serious response to gluten like some folks: I&#8217;m sure I am getting some exposure at restaurants, etc. It has certainly been eye-opening to realize how pervasive gluten is in society! I have traveled some for work, and airports are the worst culprits: your choices are pizza, sandwiches or cookies! At home I&#8217;ve started using a lot of nori wraps or multi-seed crackers, or having things like quinoa for breakfast rather than toast. It&#8217;s not too difficult at home, although it&#8217;s a bit of a challenge when I&#8217;m out and about.
