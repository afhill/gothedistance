The other day I bought some zucchini, without thinking about what I wanted to do with it. Today I decided was the day to get rid of it, in the form of muffins.

Now of course, I can&#8217;t just follow a recipe to make [Whole Wheat Zucchini Nut Muffins](http://eatingcleanrecipes.com/2010/07/whole-wheat-zucchini-nut-muffins/). No sirree. I had to mix it up a bit. 

Standard ingredients:  
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour  
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon table salt  
1/4 teaspoon baking soda  
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger  
1 egg, beaten  
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar or sucanat  
1/2 cup low-fat plain yogurt  
3 tablespoons canola or safflower oil  
1 cup finely shredded zucchini  
1 teaspoon pure vanilla  
1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans or walnuts

I used spelt flour instead of whole wheat, molasses instead of sugar, skipped the oil altogether, almonds for the nut, and used a mixture of zucchini and carrots. And added wheat germ, chia seeds and flax seed (of course üôÇ ).  
They&#8217;re pretty good, but they have the same heaviness the flax muffins did. I believe it&#8217;s due to the use of the molasses but I&#8217;m just not sure about an alternative. I just don&#8217;t want to use &#8216;sugar&#8217;-which I guess is silly since I just looked it up, and molasses is a byproduct of sugar cane processing üôÅ Still, they&#8217;ll be a nice snack and a great way to sneak in some extra veggies.
