-English muffin with almond butter  
&#8211; bar  
&#8211; tea  
-Salad with egg, tofu, mango, avocado  
&#8211; tempeh  
&#8211; cookies  
&#8211; protein shot  
&#8211; chia seeds in water with molasses  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; propel zero  
&#8211; emergen-c  
&#8211; whole grain chips  
&#8211; [butternut squash risotto](http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/butternut_squash_risotto/) with brown rice, veggie broth, earth balance and nutritional yeast in place of white rice, chicken broth, butter and cheese. The rice was a little tough but overall it wasn&#8217;t bad.  
&#8211; warm milk with turmeric and ginger. Throat still sore and I saw the turmeric/milk suggestion online. I figured since ginger also helps with inflammation it may help (and make it more palatable)

Exercise  
-Chest and biceps  
Working hard on my chest press! I&#8217;m trying to hit different weights and reps to really see gains. I also did some bar-only presses on the bench. So far the bulk of my work (heh) has been on the smith machine.  
5&#215;30, 5&#215;50, 5&#215;60, 4&#215;65  
30&#215;10, 10&#215;50, 3&#215;60, 5&#215;50, 20&#215;30  
-Bicep curls /compression curls  
-Flyes  
-Light weight lat rows and pull downs. I&#8217;ve been getting a sore neck after lats, so I dropped it down to focus on technique

This morning I volunteered at the Denver Gorilla Run, which was a blast. Picture 1000 competitors, all dressed in gorilla suits! People tend to come back year after year ( the suit is theirs to keep) and dress up their suits even more!

Then this afternoon I read &#8220;Born to Run&#8221; (finally)! Wow!! Amazing book- I&#8217;m going to dedicate a whole other post to it.
