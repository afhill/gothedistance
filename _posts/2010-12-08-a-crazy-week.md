It&#8217;s been a crazy week since the race on Sunday. I was physically tired (I could barely get out of bed Tuesday) and emotionally and mentally drained at work. I had two huge deadlines this week, and another significant unexpected problem cropped up. 13 hrs in the office Monday, 9 hrs yesterday and then I only left because I had plans, 11.5 hrs today. I actually teetered on the brink of a meltdown a few times.  
It&#8217;s funny, really, we all know that exercise is a great stress reliever. But when you have set workouts and goals for each, it becomes another obligation. I just felt earlier in the week that even if I&#8217;d had the time to work out, I wouldn&#8217;t mentally be able to focus as I&#8217;d need to. Finally tonight after the week&#8217;s second site launched, I was able to hit the gym. 

I just did the tempo workout: 1 mile warmup, 5 miles at 7:50. I was on the treadmill so I was able to manually dial back the speed when I realized I was going faster than I needed.

Target: 1 mile warmup, 5 miles at 7:50

Actual &#8211; 8:44 w/up &#8211; 7:36, 7:41, 7:54 (treadmill timed out and had to restart), 7:46, 7:48.

The run was fine: I did what I had to do. It was a good run to ease my way back into running as I just let my legs do the work on the treadmill and I could disassociate. Now that I&#8217;m done, I feel so much better! Glad to be back- although now it&#8217;s time to focus on my derby bout this weekend.years of distance running have trained my legs to expect to taper before an event.
