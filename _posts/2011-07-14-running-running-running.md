Today Frida and I headed to Coal Canyon to do some hill running at altitude. It was a great idea, but it KILLED me! I stopped to walk a few times, although I could then get going again and catch up. I got a really bad stomach cramp and actually had her go on ahead and just waited. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was going to throw up or .. anything else. No good..

The last two nights, derby practice has been hot and sweaty, and I don&#8217;t know if I just wasn&#8217;t ready for this workout. I certainly don&#8217;t want to think the ole bod can&#8217;t handle 7400ft, because I have some good runs at altitude coming up!

My leg was also giving me trouble from where I took a good hit at scrimmage last night, so sadly I decided to cancel on my planned long run with KJ for tomorrow morning. It would be a big mileage jump regardless, and with a sore leg and a 10k race on Saturday, I decided it wasn&#8217;t a good idea. I need to be in prime shape for next weekend!

In trying to dissect what happened today, I was wondering if I&#8217;ve been a bit low on complex carbs. I&#8217;ve been eating a lot of fruit, and decent protein, but not a lot of grains or anything. Who knows, but I tried to do a better job today.

It&#8217;s pretty arbitrary (I adjusted times based on the leg rankings of &#8220;mild/moderate/hard/very hard&#8221;) but fun to try to figure out. I&#8217;m really looking forward to the event! One of the RMRG skaters even designed us an awesome logo for our team shirts!
