Met the gang this morning for a chilly run at highbanks. It was 22F &#8220;realfeel&#8221; according to accuweather.com. Yuck! Decided to give my trail running shoes a workout &#8211; they seem stiff to put on, but felt good once I was out there. They gripped well, I felt strong on the hills. I did one easy loop with Meredith, and Andy, Jen, Darryl, Bob and Rich were all behind us. My left quad was a bit sore, and the inside of my right knee tingled a bit, but I actually felt really good. I probably could have done a bit more (Meredith, Bob and Darryl did 9) but decided to take it easy. I picked it up at the end and felt just fine. We all went for coffee and bagels afterwards, which was really nice. We chatted about books and such, it&#8217;s neat to have a good group of friends like that.

Off to the gym tomorrow, and I may be tempted to put in a few more easy miles, even just to bring me up to 10 for the week (I&#8217;m at a bit under 7). Definitely want to take it easy, but I was actually surprised at how ok I felt today.
