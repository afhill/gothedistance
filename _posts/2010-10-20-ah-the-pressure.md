Once you&#8217;ve earned that status as &#8220;crazy runner&#8221;, you don&#8217;t shake it easily. My boss was excited today to tell me about a marathon that&#8217;s run in Newport RI, where she has a second home. Apparently the [Amica Marathon](http://www.amicamarathon.com/) was ranked 4th in the country by Runner&#8217;s World. She eagerly showed me the website and pointed out highlights during the course. Then she announced she&#8217;d do the 5k next year, and I should do the marathon.  
Never mind the fact I keep trying to tell myself I&#8217;m going to cut back on marathons next year&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to lose an opportunity to encourage others, right??
