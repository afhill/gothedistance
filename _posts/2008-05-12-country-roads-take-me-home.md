As I dropped my parents off at the airport today, my mom asked when we would see them next. My poor parents, they are too trained. My Mom said they were planning to go to Arizona next February or March, which was after the Rock n Roll, but perhaps I could run the Flying Dutchman? They assume that a race is a good motivator for me&#8230; and they&#8217;re right&#8230;

I told them that I would rather go home than travel elsewhere to see them, just so that I would have the option to see friends. Last visit home (end of June last year), I only saw a couple friends, but at least I had the option. So I told my Mom that I was thinking about heading home this August. It didn&#8217;t take her long to realize&#8230; &#8220;oh, the [ING](http://www.marathonguide.com/races/racedetails.cfm?MIDD=2092080810) is in August!&#8221;. She said that if I ran, then she would do the half as well. Ha! Like daughter, like mother ðŸ™‚

As well, my birthday is Aug 21, and the marathon is the weekend before, so that may be a good time to be home. As I dropped them off tonight I was thinking about how the older I get, the more I appreciate my family. I think spending my birthday with them may be a good idea&#8230;
