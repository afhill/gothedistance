I started this year tracking my miles on google spreadsheets. While not as powerful as excel, it can handle something this complex ðŸ™‚ It also has the ability to create charts, as you see on the left. You can then &#8220;publish chart&#8221;, so the image is actually dynamically created by the data. It appears to capture the data at a particular time, however, I tried to modify the data after the chart code was rendered, and it didn&#8217;t update. 

As you can see, I&#8217;ve been very consistent in terms of steadily increasing mileage every week. Next week may be a little challenging, as I&#8217;ll be out of town Thursday through Sunday. I still intend to run every day, but I don&#8217;t anticipate I&#8217;ll be able to fit in any sort of significant &#8220;long run&#8221;.

Weekly run-down:  
Monday: 1mile on the treadmill before a toning class (10:00 pace)  
Tuesday: 2mile warmup, then 4x1mi @ 7:30pace, with .1m between @ ~10minpace. 1.7mile cooldown.  
Wednesday: 2 miles (9:49 pace)  
Thursday: 11miles with Meredith in NA (9:18 pace)  
Friday: 1mile outside (11:19)  
Saturday: 9miles at Highbanks (9:02 pace). First loop, 50:39.  
Sunday: 3.5miles outside (9:37)  
Weekyl total: 35.5, cumulative weekly average: 31.4
