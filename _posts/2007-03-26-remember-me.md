I haven&#8217;t run in a week. Granted, that run last Monday was a decent one (to the garage and back, about 7.5 miles), and I have good reasons for not running since. Still, I feel blah and fat and sluggish. Less than three weeks to the Cap City Half, I really need to settle down. Hopefully the nicer weather will get me more motivated, and I will take the time I know I need physically as well as mentally&#8230;.

I&#8217;ll be back running soon, I promise (myself).
