This morning I woke up NOT interested in racing. I&#8217;d run the past 5 days, it was cold, and I just wasn&#8217;t feeling focused on a strong effort. But I&#8217;d paid for the race and knew I had to get some miles in, so I went anyway. 

Although it didn&#8217;t snow as predicted, it was cold so I bundled up in tights, two long-sleeved shirts and gloves. I was so not in a &#8220;race&#8221; frame of mind that I didn&#8217;t even wear my racing shoes! I had on my chicago jacket and a headband as well, but I did decide not to run in those, and just threw the race shirt on over top my long-sleeved shirts. 

I did a couple easy miles before the race start and just felt blah. I still lined up reasonably close to the front, but without any great aspirations. When the gun went off, quite a few women bolted out ahead of me. Oh well. 

The path was clearer than last week, which did make me wish a bit that I&#8217;d been prepared to run this one harder. Instead, I chugged along and like last week, kept my eyes off my Garmin. 

While I didn&#8217;t make any real attempts to catch or pass the women ahead of me, apparently others didn&#8217;t feel the same, and I was a target. Shortly before the first mile, a gal pulled up right next to me. As in, I hit her with my arm swing. I apologized, but she stayed right by my side. Then another gal came up on the other side. Ok &#8211; so the road around Wash Park is WIDE &#8211; you could easily have 15 people abreast and not touch. These two girls were flanking me like they were my bodyguards and I was some celebrity! Within two strides, I&#8217;d made contact with both of them. I thought briefly of making a roller derby joke, but instead I exclaimed &#8220;really??&#8221; and put on a short burst of speed. It was enough, and I never saw them again. 

I did hear one of them panting behind me up a hill, as I concentrated on just running reasonably relaxed and keeping my breathing and heart rate under control. After all, I wasn&#8217;t &#8220;racing&#8221;.

Run run run. Run run run.

Soon enough I was in the final stretch, and I just didn&#8217;t have the drive to push as I had the week before. I came in in 21:14, close to 30 seconds slower than the week before.

And here we are a year later and this is my &#8220;I&#8217;m not racing&#8221; effort! I mentioned it to Frida and she said simply &#8220;you&#8217;re not the runner you were a year ago&#8221;. I guess that&#8217;s true&#8230;

Heather Utrata was standing at the finish with some other ladies who finished before me, and we chatted briefly. I mentioned I was going for a cooldown run, and she offered to join me. Then we came across Todd Straka, and he came along as well. I will admit I felt a bit like I was surrounded by Denver Runner Royalty, doing a cooldown with the #1 female and #2 male! 

We were just finishing up a loop when we heard them start to announce awards. Heather and Todd picked up their overall awards, and I even managed to place 1st in my AG (of 50!). 

I will admit I&#8217;m relieved this little series is over. As much as I&#8217;ve always said I love to race, I think I finally get it: it&#8217;s a lot more fun when you can focus and push hard and really try to squeeze out the best you can do. That&#8217;s just not something you can do on a weekly basis if you have other goals. I finally got back up to 45 miles for the first time since Houston, and I want to do more than just spin my wheels fast for 20 minutes on a Sunday morning. I&#8217;m certainly excited about some of the events I have coming up, and I&#8217;m eager to prepare and focus on them to truly see what I&#8217;m capable of!
