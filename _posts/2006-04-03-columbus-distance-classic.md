Yes, I still owe a race report for the Crown King Scramble.. it&#8217;s in the works. In the meantime&#8230;

Saturday was the Columbus Distance Classic. I hadn&#8217;t been feeling too great leading up to it: I haven&#8217;t done any sort of speedwork all winter, and not running roads much at all. I ran 6 miles Wednesday, and just felt awkward. Thursday I got in a mid two miles, and found my quads hurt when I tried to pick up the pace a bit. Uh oh!

In the end, it all went well. I started out on my own but met up with Meredith and Helen within the first mile. We ran the rest of the run together. None of us were particularly interested in &#8216;racing&#8217;, and we all had various aches and pains. It was really cool to run together; for awhile we ran with Mike, and we talked with Jen for a moment as well.

The three of us ran well. I stopped a few times for a walking water break, then would catch up again. In the end, I think we all did well and were happy with how we did. My final time? 1:43:31 &#8211; my third best half-marathon. pretty good considering I really wasn&#8217;t pushing myself as hard as I could have been.

Amber was there to cheer me on at various parts of the course, and it was so nice to see her out there supporting me. At one point she was watching with Bridget and Brian, and as I ran up, Bridget asked why I had the big ole grin on my face..

As we were running, Meredith mentioned that this was her first race this year. I was a bit surprised myself when I realized I&#8217;ve run 1 5K, 2 half marathons, 2 marathons and an ultra! And I told myself I was going to race less this year&#8230;
