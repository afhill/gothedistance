Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be headed out on my first official bike ride with a friend. I&#8217;ve been hitting the trainer for awhile, and over the past few weeks have ridden to work several times (2.9 miles each way). But tomorrow I&#8217;m meeting a friend for a \*real\*bike\*ride\* at 7am. I&#8217;m eager and excited, but also a bit nervous. Running every weekend is pretty standard for me, I know what to eat before, what to wear, generally what to expect. This is a bit different. I don&#8217;t really know how long we&#8217;re going for, and I had to break down and inquire about what to wear. I&#8217;m excited, it should be fun.. if not a likely first step into a new weekend activity!
