This weekend I&#8217;ll be running the [Bourbon Chase](http://www.bourbonchase.com) relay, my first relay since Hood to Coast back in 2005. Technology has stepped it up since then, and folks can track the progress of my team via an iPhone tracking app!

The site to check out is Running Escapes, although supposedly there will also be updates to the main race website. The Running Escapes site will show a map and our location will be updated whenever we check in at an exchange. The app was a bit clunky, but it let us input all the team members, their pace and estimated time they&#8217;ll be at the next exchange. Who needs paper and pencils? (hmmm, possibly people without phone chargers??)

Our team, Three Old Crows, Nine Spring Chickens, will start at 3pm on Friday and expect to finish in about 27 hours. Our progress can be viewed at: <http://runningescapes.com/relaytracker/TeamMap.aspx?TeamName=Three%20Old%20Crows,%20Nine%20Spring%20Chickens>
