Speed workout!

This is a pretty crazy week for me work-wise, so I wasn&#8217;t sure about this workout. Generally I like to run in the mornings but I worked late and then got up in a panic and worked more. Then I thought about taking a long lunch, but that also wasn&#8217;t feasible. I finally rolled up to the rec center after 7pm, not sure how the workout would go.

And with each workout comes more confidence&#8230; ðŸ™‚

Today&#8217;s plan was 10 min warmup, 3x(2x .75m in 5:10, 2min RI), 4mi RI between sets, 10 min cooldown. 

My micromanaging continued, with a given target of 41 seconds per lap (which really would give me 5:07 per rep). 

1: 5:06  
2: 5:04

1. 5:07  
2. 5:08

1. 5:09  
2. 5:09

So.. little bit of a slow there, but they were still all below the real target time. Between the warmup, rest intervals and cooldowns I tacked on an additional 3.05 miles to the 4.5 at pace, so got in a 7.55mile workout.

Now, maybe it was the bing energy drink I had this afternoon (I didnt realize it was an energy drink), but my heart rate got up to a crazy bpm at the end there&#8230; on the day of an afterwork run. Any guesses how long til I&#8217;m able to fall asleep??

7.55 miles in 1:04:50 (8:35 pace). Average HR &#8211; 170, Max HR 190.

Today&#8217;s chart is brought to you by that crazy heart rate. I actually think this is really cool to see the role those rest intervals play ðŸ™‚ 

_Edit: I just went back and looked, and the last time my heart rate got up to 190 running was in April &#8211; looks like I may have run a 5K, as the distance is just around 3.1 miles. Wowza! (I say &#8216;running&#8217; explicitly because I suspect it&#8217;s shot up while skating)_
