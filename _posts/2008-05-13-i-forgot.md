they say it takes 3 weeks to develop a habit. I don&#8217;t know about that, since it&#8217;s been 5 months since I decided to run every day, and yesterday I forgot!

Granted, it was a busy day, and I had the best intentions. Yesterday morning I headed out to hocking hills with my parents, where we hiked around a bit. I had planned to drop them at the airport (their flight was at 7pm) and then hit the gym. We ended up having dinner at the airport before they left, so I went home to digest. The next thing I knew it was 11:45 and I hadn&#8217;t run! Even a dedicated runner like me was not about to set out at midnight. 

So I missed my day of running. To make up for it, though, I&#8217;m doing a double today. I just got home from 3 miles and I&#8217;ll hit the gym tonight. That way I&#8217;ll have the proper number of workouts, even if in that 24 hr period I didn&#8217;t run.
