We got a new web dev contractor here at work at the beginning of December. Cecil is a great guy, AND he&#8217;s a cyclist! He&#8217;s in the gym for at least an hour a day, beating me on the workout front here at the office. He often stops by to ask about how my training is going, and it&#8217;s some subtle encouragement when it would be easy to take a day off or have an easy workout. Lately another contractor at work has been wanting to head down to the gym as well, so we&#8217;ve been co-ordinating our workout times. Often I head outside to run anyway, but it&#8217;s still nice to all walk down to the locker rooms together.

I&#8217;ve had running on my calendar for awhile, but I think it&#8217;s neat that 3 of the 4 contractors down in our little area are all aspiring to work out in the afternoons. Cecil also does his longer workout on Wednesdays, so I just set up a recurring meeting for &#8220;web developer contractors to work out their frustrations at the gym&#8221; 3x a week. 

I want to get into the habit of working out here at work daily, I think if I just get used to it, the time spent showering and all that crap won&#8217;t be such a deterrent (right now I often bring workout clothes, then take them back home and run when I get home, just so that I&#8217;m not adding that extra time to my workday). it&#8217;s a heck of a lot easier to know that my coworkers are doing the same.
