As it gets colder, but I want to do speedwork, I started to look for options. The local rec center was suggested. The American rec center is a totally great but foreign concept for me &#8211; those things are cool! AND there is a center less than two miles away from my apartment, directly on the bike trail I run on. Perfect!

I stopped by tonight to check the place out. They asked if I lived in the district, and I said I wasn&#8217;t sure. We checked out the big map on the wall..

See that little island of white, where the district is above and below? Yeah, that&#8217;s where I live. Sigh. So I can either pay non-resident fees or drive to my district&#8217;s rec center. :-/
