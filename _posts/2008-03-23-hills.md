Earlier in the week when I decided I wasn&#8217;t going to run Athens, I started to really focus on the marathon(s) I was going to run this Spring.

Both Boston and Cincy are hilly courses. For all the running I&#8217;ve done this year, what have I not been doing much of? hills.

So I endeavoured to change that this week. 

Wednesday: 10 miles on the treadmill, first 4 were on the &#8220;random&#8221; setting. Level 8 &#8211; Max grade 6.3%  
1: 9:21 &#8211; avgHR 156  
2: 9:31 &#8211; avgHR 165  
3: 9:30 &#8211; avgHR 163  
4: 9:30 &#8211; avgHR 165  
I then did the next 6 miles on 0 incline, at a bit faster speed.

Friday: 3.5 miles at Highbanks in 34:46. I did the bottom loop backwards (hence the slowest last mile with the highest heart rate)  
1: 9:58 &#8211; avgHR 158  
2. 9:33 &#8211; avgHR 154  
3. 10:09 &#8211; avgHR 166  
.5 10:14pace &#8211; avgHR 174

And today I hit it hard: a full 18 miles at Highbanks. That&#8217;s 3 full loops (~5.64 each loop), with 1.26 cooldown at the end. I stopped for water between each loop. It was nice out, but it got muddier and muddier as the day went on. After the first loop, I made an effort to finish each faster than the previous.  
Loop 1: 51:40  
Loop 2: 50:29  
Loop 3: 50:04

1: 9:28  
2: 9:21  
3: 9:23  
4: 8:51  
5: 9:15  
6: 8:40  
7: 9:16  
8: 9:31  
9: 9:04  
10: 9:31  
11: 8:33  
12: 8:58  
13: 9:27  
14: 8:46  
15: 8:37  
16: 9:23  
17: 8:44  
18: 9:57

My average heart rate was 166, my max was 186 in the 12th mile and 185 in the seventeenth (when I was trying to finish a loop strong!) TIme was 2:44:53, which is a 9:09 average pace. My last mile was an easy jog around the parking lot. I did stop and walk up part of the last big hill on the last loop, but overall I felt really strong and good. I know I&#8217;m the best trained for Boston as I&#8217;ve ever been. This may be the year I BQ there ðŸ™‚
