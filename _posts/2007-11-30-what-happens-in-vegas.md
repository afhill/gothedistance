I&#8217;m sitting here at the Columbus airport, getting ready to fly to Vegas for the marathon (#15, my 10th state).&nbsp; When I arrived at the airport, I went right to Southwest, which is well-known for its direct flights to Sin City. When I tried to check in (just with my ID), they said they only had record of my flight from Chicago to Vegas, not for the leg from Columbus to Vegas. Wha&#8230;?&nbsp; I was a little worried/concerned/confused about all this.&nbsp; The flight was also delayed and overbooked, so the people at the ticket counter left me to look up my confirmation online&#8230; as they tried to figure out if they could add me to the first leg. 

I booted up my laptop, looked up my confirmation&#8230; for my flight on a different airline.

What&#8217;s interesting is that there IS an Andrea Hill flying from Chicago to Vegas tonight. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it is the same Andrea Hill who ran&nbsp; Chicago when I did in 2006, or Columbus in 2005. It would make sense: she IS from IL. How funny is that if we were running another marathon at the same time again???
