First off, for those of you who were wondering, I did NOT break my running streak. I did a recovery run (HR < 153) of 6 miles on Sunday, to hit 40 for the week. My knee has been fine since. Go me!

So this week racing starts- Saturday is the [Columbus Running Company One Mile Dash](http://www.columbusrunning.com/mile.htm). I have a love-hate relationship with this race. Actually, it&#8217;s mostly hate-hate. This year I think I am particularly not ready for it, but we&#8217;ll see how it goes. 

Then today, Helen posted on Facebook that she was thinking about doing the 15K in Hilliard on Sunday. Hmm&#8230; Helen always kicks my butt in shorter races but I&#8217;d love to try to keep up with her. 

And of course next Saturday is our [Buckeye Trail 50K](http://www.buckeyetrail50k.com/bt50k.html). I&#8217;m looking forward to it, just today a guy at work was checking out list of races (yes, I have a map and a list of my marathon times in my pod) and happened to ask me about the [Crown King Scramble](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2006/03/wow-2/). It got me even more excited about what&#8217;s to come!
