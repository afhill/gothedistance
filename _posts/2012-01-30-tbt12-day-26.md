#### Food

&#8211; coffee  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; veggie burger on wheat bread, sauteed mushrooms, salad bar (inc chickpeas, hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese)  
&#8211; almonds and raisins  
&#8211; cranberry, pear &#8220;pizza&#8221; on whole wheat flatbread with spinach, goat cheese and vinegarette. I&#8217;ve decided that a small amount of goat cheese is allowed as a protein source.  
&#8211; cole slaw

#### Exercise

&#8211; 6 mile run

I&#8217;m in Rhode Island for work, which means longish days with coworkers. The place that had been picked for dinner was NOT very TBT or vegetarian-friendly and I was a bit bummed about it. Then it turned out to be closed (it&#8217;s the offseason here) so we ended up at a cute restaurant where I had a clean and fun &#8220;pizza&#8221;- whole wheat flatbread, spinach, pean and cranberries with a touch of goat cheese. I was trying to be subtle with my picture-taking, which is why it&#8217;s blurry. Its nice to have alternatives to salad!

I think one of my coworkers mentioned to my bosses that I no longer eat seafood, which is a relief. I don&#8217;t like to make a big deal and force others to make changes based on my diet. My boss had been planning to do a big lobster dinner for us all tomorrow, do we&#8217;ll see what accommodations are made. I&#8217;m actually considering taking an early cheat day this week just so I can at least drink with everyone!
