At long last, back above 40 miles in a week, and I&#8217;m feeling really great!

Monday: rest  
Tuesday: ran in the morning with Sara (4 miles easy), then did a [hill workout on the TM](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2016/06/hitting-the-hills-on-the-treadmill/) in the afternoon

Wednesday: ran intervals with Sara (4.5 miles total)

Thursday: ran a 6.14mile tempo run with Rev Running: 50 min total, with the last 15 @ HMP. I was targeting 7:15 &#8211; 7:25 for the HMP.  
1: 8:26  
2: 8:32  
3: 8:29  
4: 8:25  
5: 7:23 (you can see where I picked up!)  
6: 7:15  
7: 7:03  
&#8212;- average pace: 8:03

Friday: 5 miles with Sara: 1 mile warmup, 3 miles at her HMP, 1 mile cooldown. Her target pace is ~9:09 but she has her Garmin set for a range that lets her go up to 8:51. Her race pace miles? 8:49, 8:52, 8:52. ðŸ™‚

Saturday: Long run with Kaydee, Mary and Maureen from Rev Running. 15 miles in 2:15:21 (9:01 pace)

Sunday: Back to Barr Trail! We decided to run an hour up. I got up to 3.5 miles in 1:01:00. Then we had to walk a bit on the way down so I only ran 3.4 down for a total of 6.9miles in 1:40:23.  
I felt SO much better on the downhill today! I can tell I&#8217;m getting my downhill trail legs back; much more willing to hop over rocks than hold myself back out of fear of tripping. Looking forward to the race in just a few weeks!  
1: 16:38  
2: 18:10  
3: 16:56  
4: 13:48 (up and down)  
5: 11:40  
6: 11:45  
.9: 11:10

Compared to last time, my ups were slower but my downs were better!  
1: 15:57  
2: 17:28  
3: 16:42  
&#8212; bottom 3 back down  
8: 11:42  
9: 12:37  
10: 12:11

Overall: 43.67 miles &#8211; most in a long time, and I&#8217;m feeling really strong! I definitely think that the shorter, more focused runs are helping!
