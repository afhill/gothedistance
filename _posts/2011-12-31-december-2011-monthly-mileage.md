Another &#8220;biggest month ever&#8221;! 

181 miles this month &#8211; that&#8217;s 10 more than November despite the fact I&#8217;ve started tapering for Houston. 

I went on quite a streak, running 13 days straight for a total of 104 miles.

I WON a 5K race ([which later turned out not to be 5k, but I still won, darnit!](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/12/rudolph-ramble-race-report/))

I&#8217;m finishing the year just under 1000 miles, but most of my miles have been since I decided to give up derby in August (and actually quit in September). I&#8217;m pretty sure I will see closer to 2000 miles next year!
