A few days ago when I said I was going to restart the TBT, a friend said &#8220;right before the marathon?&#8221; (I&#8217;m running the Houston marathon on Jan 15th). I cheekily replied that it really wasn&#8217;t much different than what I&#8217;m doing now, I&#8217;d just be writing it down. 

Well, it turns out that accountability to you, dear reader, has ALREADY come into play. Yup, day 1 and I &#8220;slipped&#8221;!

There were probably 20 of us who huddled around a campfire until well past 1am, and then headed down Barr Trail. So my first few hours of 2012, I was already working out! I went to bed shortly before 3 but still woke before 8. On my way home from the Springs I stopped at Starbucks for a &#8216;treat&#8217;. I mostly gave up coffee when I did my first round of the TBT, now I have it perhaps once a month. At Starbucks I ordered a non-fat chai&#8230; and was nearly done before I remembered the sad day last year when we discovered there are **[35g of sugar](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/foods-from-starbucks/9642/2)** in these. I cheated already, accidentally!

Just a reminder not to take things for granted. Sugar in particular is in pretty well everything. Yes, even ketchup and salad dressing. Sigh. 

Food  
&#8211; peanut butter powerbar (half consumed at 2:30am)  
&#8211; omelet with spinach and tomato  
&#8211; peaches  
&#8211; starbucks nf chai :-((  
&#8211; edamame  
&#8211; 2 apples  
&#8211; greek yogurt with honey  
&#8211; whole grain crackers and hummus  
&#8211; delicious salad (mixed greens, tomato, carrot, mushrooms, apple, hemp seeds, quorn chikn cutlet, pistachios and a mix of balsamic vinegar and this amazing [citrus habanero olive oil](http://sedonaoliveoil.com/citrushabanerooo-375ml.html) I bought last week)  
&#8211; banana  
&#8211; [amazing meal](http://amazinggrass.com/product/4/Amazing-Meal-Pomegranate-Mango-Infusion-30-servings.html) with almond milk  
&#8211; banana, almond butter, hemp seed in a whole wheat tortilla* 

Exercise  
&#8211; 2.4 mile hike in the dark!  
&#8211; 4 mile run  
&#8211; [P90X Ab Ripper X workout](http://www.fleetly.com/people/14997/workouts/p90x-ab-ripper-x)  
&#8211; [Lower Body Stretches](http://www.fleetly.com/workouts/lower-body-stretch)

I did NOT feel very energetic today. I&#8217;m sure it was a combination of not eating well yesterday, not eating enough today before running and campfire smoke inhalation last night. 

Tomorrow I get to start [Crossfit](http://www.crossfitlodo.com/)!! (I have a 20-pass card from some daily discount site)

*for those of you new to the TBT, this is a favorite snack of mine. The hemp seeds and nut butter are high in protein, the banana and the whole wheat tortilla are the complex carbs. Yet it feels like a treat!
