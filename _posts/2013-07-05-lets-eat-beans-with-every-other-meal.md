What North American kid hasn&#8217;t heard that little ditty? But whereas the song simply recommended eating beans for their \*ahem\* musical properties, there may be some health benefits as well.

[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4627" alt="beans" src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/beans.jpg" width="276" height="183" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/beans.jpg)In his video &#8220;[Beans and the Second Meal Effect](http://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-and-the-second-meal-effect/)&#8220;, Dr. Michael Greger introduces research that demonstrates that not only does the low glycemic index of beans and lentil temper an insulin spike when eaten with carbs, it seems to continue forward to the next meal as well! So if you eat beans or lentils at breakfast, you continue to reap the benefits of this tempering effect at lunch. Same too with beans or lentils at dinner cascading over to help offset spikes at breakfast.

I recently listened to the Tim Ferriss Four Hour Body audiobook and he advocates a &#8220;Slow carb&#8221; diet, including [eating legumes with every meal](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise/). I don&#8217;t know how much of this science Tim was aware of, but it&#8217;s neat to see a study piggyback on what I was just listening to!

As a plant-based athlete, I often get the &#8220;where do you get your protein&#8221; question and I think I&#8217;m going to try to make a more conscious effort to include legumes more frequently &#8211; twice a day certainly seems reasonable.
