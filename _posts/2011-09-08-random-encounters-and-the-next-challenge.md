In the past two days, I&#8217;ve had great conversations with random runners: Jonathan caught up with me while running yesterday, and today I commented on Bill&#8217;s PPM shirt at Starbucks, which lead to a 20 minute conversation. 

I&#8217;m not one for small talk, so I have to marvel a bit when runners can launch into discussions like we do. But what really struck me about these two conversations is that both of them lead to the other person telling me I should try a 50 Miler ðŸ™‚

Yes, for many people the marathon is the ultimate goal. Somehow in this running mecca I call Colorado, I keep encountering these folks who can so easily recommend I run further than most people are willing to drive without griping. 

My chiropractor also recommended I do a 50 Miler today, but he&#8217;s mentioned ultra running before, so he doesn&#8217;t really count. But really? Two random discussions with strangers, with the same sentiment? Something&#8217;s in the air&#8230;

The fellow today recommended [Collegiate Peaks](http://www.collegiatepeakstrailrun.org/). We&#8217;ll see&#8230;
