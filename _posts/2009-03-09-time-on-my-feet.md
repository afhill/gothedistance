After the Last Chance race a few weeks ago, I went out for dinner with <a href="http://www.marathonjunkie.com" rel="nofollow">Chuck &#8220;MarathonJunkie&#8221; Engle</a> and my friend Helen. Chuck has already run 10 marathons in &#8217;09, and placed in all but one (winning 4). I told him that I&#8217;ve noticed myself fading in late miles and asked him for advice. He asked my weekly mileage, and told me that the single most important thing to focus on was &#8220;time on my feet&#8221;. They could be easy miles, but simply to log the time.

I listened:  
February Run Time: 6:59:14  
March Run Time (up thru 03/08): 8:00:05

Yes, I&#8217;ve already logged more time on my feet in 8 days than I did all last month.. I&#8217;m definitely over my &#8220;burn-out&#8221;!
