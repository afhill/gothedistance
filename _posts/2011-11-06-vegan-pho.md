People in Denver (or at least, the people I know in Denver) looooove their Pho. I did too, at least until I decided to cut animal products out of my diet. Since then I&#8217;ve been nervous about ordering the Vietnamese soup. Even without putting in chicken, I was pretty sure a meat-based broth was used (in fact, I read somewhere that the literal translation of Pho means &#8220;beef noodle soup&#8221; or some such thing). So, I&#8217;ve been Pho-less for awhile. 

There&#8217;s one good way to know what&#8217;s in the food you&#8217;re eating, and that&#8217;s to make it yourself. So I turned to Google, and came up with a [Vegetarian Pho](http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/soup/recipe-vegetarian-pho-107312) recipe to try. 

Now, I&#8217;m starting to cook more, but my skills aren&#8217;t quite up to snuff. I had no idea how to char ginger, so I sorta kinda tried but I&#8217;m not sure it was quite right.

&#8211; ginger root  
&#8211; star anise  
&#8211; cinnamon stick  
&#8211; cloves  
&#8211; ground coriander (recipe called for seeds but I didn&#8217;t have any)  
&#8211; vegetable broth  
&#8211; soy sauce  
&#8211; carrots (weird. I used a couple but I&#8217;m not sure why.. I didn&#8217;t actually eat any ðŸ™‚ )  
&#8211; green onions

Noodles  
&#8211; bean mung noodles

Garnishes  
&#8211; bean sprouts  
&#8211; jalapeno  
&#8211; portabello mushroom  
&#8211; lime  
&#8211; basil  
&#8211; sriracha sauce &#8211; the one &#8220;not completely clean&#8221; thing as it has sugar in it

I meant to include tofu but I forgot to press it in advance, so the meal was lacking some protein, but it tasted delish! I think with the veggie broth and the lack of chicken, I was actually able to enjoy the spice of the broth more than normal. Definitely a great &#8220;comfort food&#8221; meal!
