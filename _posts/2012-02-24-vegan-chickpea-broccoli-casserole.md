I found a chickpea broccoli casserole in my [Vegan with a Vengeance](http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Vengeance-Delicious-Animal-Free-Recipes/dp/1569243581/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) cookbook. I knew I had some broccoli in my fridge, perfect! Of course as it turned out, I didn&#8217;t have enough broccoli, so I did have to make a quick run to the store..

The recipe overall was really straightforward:

3 cans of chickpeas, mashed up  
1 diced onion (I used red onion)  
3 grated carrots  
4 cups broccoli florets  
1/2 cup breadcrumbs (I used hemp fourteener and rye bread)  
1 cup veggie broth  
3 tbs olive oil  
3 tbs hemp seed (my addition)  
(the recipe also called for chives, but I didn&#8217;t have any)

Preheat the oven to 350. 

In a large bowl, mash up the chickpeas. Add the veggies, and mix together. Add the breadcrumbs, mix again. And the veggie broth and oil and hemp seed, mix. 

Spoon ingredients into a casserole dish, cover with foil and bake for 45 min. Remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes. 

The description of the recipe actually cautioned that it was a rather bland recipe, but I really didn&#8217;t think it was too bad. I did end up using some sriracha, but in all it wasn&#8217;t too bad on its own. I&#8217;ll definitely make it again!
