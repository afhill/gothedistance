The official note came out from the Flying Pig today &#8211; the course was .2517 too long. They provided entrants with an adjusted calculator, and Jen&#8217;s 3:46:17 became **3:44:08** &#8212; she&#8217;s going to Boston with us!!!

I&#8217;m as excited about this race as I have been about any of my own! ðŸ™‚
