Before we started running on Sunday, Matt announced that registration for the [Barr Trail Mountain Race](http://www.runpikespeak.com/course.htm) was opening the next day. It&#8217;s a cheap race: registration was $15 from 2-4am the first day of registration, then $30 until the race filled after that. Sure, it&#8217;s cheap, but I didn&#8217;t know what the race was, so I dismissed it.

As I started running with Mike and James, they asked if I was planning to run the race. It turns out that the run we did on Sunday was actually basically the race, with a few extra miles tacked on between the park (where our cars were) and the start of the trail. 

As I&#8217;m sure is obvious from my [run report](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/05/barr-trail-run/), I really enjoyed the trail. So, what do you think I did today?

<!--more-->Yes, I 

[registered for the Barr Trail Mountain Race](http://www.runpikespeak.com/course.htm). July 12th, 7am. (ew! 7am? I didn&#8217;t check that first&#8230;)

When I first looked at the race site, I noted the 3.5 hr cutoff. However, the race is estimated at 12.575 miles, and our &#8216;run&#8217; the other day included an extra 2.5 miles, a snickers break and some sightseeing! 

Next week the Incline club is doing the Barr Camp run again, and I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;ll miss it. I am looking forward to getting to know this trail well, so when August 16th rolls around, I&#8217;ll be ready!

**Note:** The [course description](http://www.runpikespeak.com/course.htm) page on the website has some great photos from the course, so you can see what I ran yesterday.
