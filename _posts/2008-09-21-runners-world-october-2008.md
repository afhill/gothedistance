I can&#8217;t think of the last time I bought Runner&#8217;s World magazine. Today I picked one up for reading on the plane, and it was a fantastic issue! For one thing, because it&#8217;s late in marathon season, there was no &#8220;how to run a marathon in 2.5miles a week&#8221; cockamamie plan. Instead, there was an incredible story called &#8220;Life and Limb&#8221;. The teaser on the front of the magazine asked &#8220;Would you cut off your leg so you could keep running? Tom White did. This is his story&#8221;. This is the sort of stuff I&#8217;m interested in: someone&#8217;s story. Most people think runners are extreme, fanatical, pick-your-adjective. Only a fellow runner understands some of the things we do. &#8220;Life and Limb&#8221; is truly an amazing story. It got into detail about Tom&#8217;s journey-physical, mental and emotional. Essentially, Tom was a runner who was injured in a motorcycle accident in college. He got back into running a few years later, but the article picks up as Tom is realizing that his old injuries are preventing him from participating in the sport that helps to define who he is. The doctor makes a tremendous decision to amputate, and then must learn to run (and live) anew&#8230;

There was also a story about pace teams written by a pace group leader. He made plenty of mention of his co-leader, Starshine Blackford. Star is from Columbus, a year older than me. Although I&#8217;ve never officially met her, I&#8217;m used to seeing her name in results listings (ahead of my own!) Her 101 marathons make my 20 look like child&#8217;s play!

The magazine was also enjoyable in light of my impending move to Colorado. I don&#8217;t know how many times Colorado or Boulder was mentioned! One event I did take note of (and will participate in if I remember!) &#8211; the [Denver Gorilla Run](http://www.denvergorillarun.com/)!  
Every participant in this race to benefit the mountain gorilla conservation fund receives a full gorilla costume to wear during the 5.6K race! There are some fun prizes as well. Sure, it&#8217;ll be the week after the Denver Marathon, but this is a fun run, right??
