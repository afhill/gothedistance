In the ever-increasing list of running excuses I&#8217;ve started since moving to Colorado, this is the latest. 

I&#8217;m just plain sick of long runs. I set out today for a &#8220;maybe 15, maybe 20&#8221; miler, and was ready to throw in the towel within a couple miles. 

When I first moved here, all I had was running and work, and when I ran, I thought about work. So, I didn&#8217;t like long runs. Now, I have a completely different problem. I have work, derby, friends a pool and a comfortable bed, and now when I go to run, I worry if I will be done in time to do everything else I need to do. (the bed comes into play because I don&#8217;t seem able to get up super early to run). 

Trail running here is still awesome, but that&#8217;s not appropriate for a long (distance) run. Yesterday I did 6.xx miles at the Red Mesa Loop, and it was gorgeous. Today&#8217;s jaunt on the local flat path is just incredibly boring and unrewarding. 

A couple I ran with occasionally in Columbus recently moved here; perhaps hooking up with them would help alleviate some of this boredom. Because right now, there are so many other things I&#8217;d rather be doing than pounding the path for hours on end..
