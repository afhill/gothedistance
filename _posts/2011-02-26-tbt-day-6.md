Exercise: Arms day! Again, I didn&#8217;t have as much time at the gym as I&#8217;d have liked üôÅ

  * 10mile bike ride
  * Dumbbell curls 20lbs &#8211; (5-5-3), 15lbs &#8211; (9)
  * [Barbell curls lying against an incline](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-curls-lying-against-an-incline): 15lbs -(10 &#8211; 9), 12lbs -(15)
  * [Cable one-arm tricep extension](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/cable-one-arm-tricep-extension): &#8220;Level 1&#8221; &#8211; (3&#215;15)
  * [Bench dips (with feet on a swiss ball)](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/bench-dips): (3&#215;15)
  * [Cross-body hammer curl](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/cross-body-hammer-curl):  
    15lbs -(3&#215;15). I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was doing these right..
  * [Dumbbell one-arm triceps extension](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/dumbbell-one-arm-triceps-extension): 15lbs R -(15-15), L &#8211; (15-8). I stopped the left set as I started to get wobbly and felt unsafe üôÅ The weakness seemed to be in my shoulder.
  * [tricep pushups](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/push-ups-close-triceps-position) (3&#215;15) 

Food (why is it I seem to eat better at work than at home??):  
2 pieces Granola bar  
Grapefruit  
Probar  
Apple  
Amazing meal  
Banana  
Quinoa, black beans, steamed Brussels sprouts  
Celery, carrots, broccoli  
Oranges  
Banana bread  
Lox, falafel chips, cottage cheese,. Which I hoped would be a healthy equivalent to lox, bagel, cream cheese. Nope.

Tonight we had a get-together at our practice space, with a bit of a spread of snacks. I was smart and ate before I went, and then stuck to veggies and oranges. I also talked about the TBT with one of our new skaters, I&#8217;m hoping I can get her to give it a try!
