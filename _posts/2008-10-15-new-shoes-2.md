At the 10K last Saturday, I received a coupon for $10 off a new pair of shoes if I recycled my old ones. As my old shoes are ripe for replacement, I decided to do some shopping. 

I went in to the local [Runners Roost](http://www.runnersroost.com) on Monday and they didn&#8217;t have the Omni Moderate, only the Ultimate. I gave it a try, but I didn&#8217;t want to make too dramatic a change this week. When I told the sales staff I had to have the shoes broken in by Sunday for the marathon, they asked if it was my first time. Uh, no. I know it&#8217;s a typical newbie mistake, but I&#8217;m definitely a repeat offender! I just don&#8217;t worry too much about optimizing everything for the race. 

In the end, they ordered the Moderate from another store, and I went in to pick them up last night. They have peach/pinkish trim! I put them on and they felt ok. Still, the sales staff didn&#8217;t want to leave me stranded before the race, so they told me they&#8217;d honour the coupon, but to keep my training shoes just in case, and bring them in later. I am sure the new shoes will be fine, but it is a relief to have the back-up pair. 

Sure enough, I went for a run this morning, and the new kicks felt just fine! Good support, but yet they felt really nice and springy! I&#8217;m glad I got them before Sunday!
