It only took me 4 days to realize I was labeling my posts wrong. It&#8217;s 2012, Andrea&#8230;. Sigh.

So last night I watched &#8220;[The Future of Food](http://www.hulu.com/watch/67878/the-future-of-food)&#8221; which vilified Monsanto and scared me about GMOs. It was good timing because the other day Door to Door Organics sent me a &#8220;please come back&#8221; appeal email. Halfway through the movie I renewed my order. 



I also came across this beauty at the grocery store:

Have you ever noticed that incorrect spelling of a product name is directly proportional to its sugar content. Case in point: froot loops. Anyhow, these &#8220;nutritional&#8221; cookies? Guess what the first ingredient is? Yup- sugar. 

It actually made me upset. How misleading: someone sees this and thinks they&#8217;re being good for their family. There&#8217;s no HFCS! There&#8217;s calcium! Ugh&#8230;. 

Anyway&#8230;

#### Food

  * green tea (I&#8217;ve had trouble falling asleep the past few days so I&#8217;m going to avoid black tea and see if that helps
  * Ezekiel cereal with kefir, hemp seed and blackberries
  * probar superfood slam
  * Chipotle veggie bowl with brown rice, peppers and onions, pico, corn, guac and lettuce. TBT-approved! Sure, the sodium is probably high, but nothing here is intrinsically bad
  * apple
  * homemade kombucha
  * Vega whole foods optimizer in almond milk
  * leftover tofu
  * avocado
  * banana
  * greek yogurt with blackberries and muesli

#### Exercise

  * P90X Ab ripper
  * 3 mile run. Running outside in a tshirt and shorts (and new shoes) in January helps me remember why I live in Colorado!! Although the park smelled a lot like, um, medicine.. My legs feel tired, I decided I won&#8217;t run Sunday. I need to truly taper!
  * At crossfit today we did thrusters and snatches. I was dreading the snatches from an earlier attempt at dumbbell snatches with my trainer, but these were ok. Then we did a group workout: 4 minutes, 4 activities and we had to do as many as we could (but no one in the group could be doing the same exercice at the same time): box step-ups (we could do jumps but I wasn&#8217;t feelin it today), snatches, thrusters or goblet squats. I did 68 total reps in the 4 minutes. 

Oh! I feel sooo much better today! I neti-potted and mucinexed and I&#8217;ll probably have some more turmeric/cayenne/ginger tonight but I already feel SO much better than I did yesterday! Thank goodness!
