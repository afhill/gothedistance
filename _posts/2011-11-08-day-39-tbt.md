Still not feeling great and nothing really sounded appetizing so I probably didn&#8217;t eat as much during the day as I should have.. especially considering I&#8217;ve dropped weight AND am trying to ramp up my training and get well üôÅ I used this as an excuse to hit up a buffet for dinner!

&#8211; falafel, hummus, tomato, bean sprouts on a whole wheat tortilla  
&#8211; Gatorade pre-run  
&#8211; honeymilk post-run  
&#8211; brown rice, saag paneer, vegetable korma, samosa, more BUT NO NAAN  
&#8211; apple
