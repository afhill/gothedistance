Breakfast: turns out it wasn&#8217;t the stove, I just don&#8217;t like the oats I have at home. Took a single bite.  
Am: perfect foods bar, coffee with creamer, bazi  
Lunch: coconut crusted tilapia, brown rice, spinach, tomato  
Pm: banana, plum, amazing meal with skim milk, birthday cake!, avocado, orange

I had to get up early today so I caffeinated. I don&#8217;t want to get in the habit, but I figured it was ok for a one-off.

I noticed I&#8217;m starting to see some cheek definition, which I&#8217;m happy about. Nothing too dramatic and only in certain light at a certain angle, but I&#8217;ve heard before that&#8217;s a sign a marathoner is really ready for competition: nice and lean. 

I&#8217;ve been pretty tired the last few mornings and was wondering about my iron levels. I eat a ton of spinach though so I thought I&#8217;d be doing ok. Then tonight I was looking up &#8220;iron absorption inhibitors&#8221;, and imagine my surprise when spinach was on the list! <http://www.healthcastle.com/iron.shtml>  
(more info on myths about iron here: <http://thealkalinediet.org/blog/7-common-myths-on-iron-nutrition-exposed>.) I&#8217;m glad I came across this, I thought my love for spinach had me set!

As i was enjoying some deliciously unhealthy cake today at work, I decided I&#8217;m a &#8220;social eater&#8221; &#8211; if a social situation has crappy food, I&#8217;ll partake, but make healthier choices on my own. I see that as both good and bad, I suppose.

Tonight I had MHC practice. I got to our practice space early and got in my 1000 AB exercises. I realized I shouldn&#8217;t say crunches bc I do some different things. Then we had a 2 hr practice but I didn&#8217;t participate in much of it. It&#8217;s tough to balance being prudent with wanting to stay in shape. Tomorrow I start physical therapy!
