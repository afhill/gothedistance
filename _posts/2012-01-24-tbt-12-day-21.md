#### Food

&#8211; [chia chai pudding](http://www.choosingraw.com/chia-chai-pudding/) &#8211; not as good as the blueberry ginger  
&#8211; egg whites, spinach tomato, basil pesto on a whole grain toasted bagel  
&#8211; coffee  
-PROBar  
&#8211; spinach salad with tomato, cucumber, bean sprouts, garbanzo beans, hemp seed and the [red pepper, chickpea and tahini dressing](http://www.choosingraw.com/creamy-red-pepper-chickpea-and-tahini-dressing/) I made the other day  
&#8211; apple  
&#8211; cashews  
&#8211; vega pre-workout optimizer with creatine and BCAAs  
&#8211; homemade protein bar  
&#8211; honeymilk  
&#8211; green curry with tofu and brown rice

Today I had some tedious work to do, so I went to Panera to enjoy their bottomless coffee to hammer it out. I LOOOVE hazelnut coffee! But because I rarely drink coffee anymore, I cut it with decaf. 

A friend posted this picture on my blog and said she wanted abs like the girl in black. That turned into a discussion about females&#8217; abs. I actually would love to have even more definition, but I&#8217;m just not sure if I&#8217;m genetically capable.

    The abs *I* want!

The good news, though, is that that discussion lead me to go do some abwork!

#### Exercise

&#8211; ab ripper x  
&#8211; [9.5 mile run with the RRBs in 1:20](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/running-post-houston/). Yay! My coach kept telling me to slow down..  
&#8211; then I stopped by the gym on my way home to work on my bench press. I decided to focus more on endurance than heavy weight. Did 30 reps at 55lbs, then 9 reps at 75lbs. I&#8217;d have probably done another set but some guys seemed to be loitering and looking for the bench (yes, the bench, they weren&#8217;t creepos). So I went and did some dumbbell presses as well. 10x30lb dumbbells, 12x30lb dumbbells, 25x20lb dumbbells. Feeling good about the Pump and Run!
