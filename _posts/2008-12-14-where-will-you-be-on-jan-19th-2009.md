  Hard to believe that in exactly five weeks time, I will be celebrating  and planning a trip to New York.
  
  Those are the thoughts that were going through my head again and again during today's run.  It got down to -2F today, the coldest day in Colorado since I moved here, and as I gutted out my 16 miles, I just kept telling myself: this is what is going to get me to New York. This is how it gets done.

Hard to believe that in exactly five weeks time, I will be celebrating, and planning a trip to New York. 

Those are the thoughts that were going through my head again and again during today&#8217;s run. It got down to -2F today, the coldest day in Colorado since I moved here, and as I gutted out my 16 miles, I just kept telling myself: this is what is going to get me to New York. This is how it gets done. 

<!--more-->Yes, as I headed out on fresh-fallen snow, bundled up and wearing my 

[yaktrax](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/03/now-thats-dedication-guy-watching-me-run-by-outside/), I joked that this was NOT preparing me for Arizona at all! But the tougher the workout, the easier the race, right?

<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/weekmileage.jpg" alt="weekmileage" title="weekmileage" width="210" height="328" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-758" /> Today&#8217;s workout was 16-18 miles, and I noticed as I headed out that I&#8217;d run 31.25 miles as of this morning. A teeny tiny part of me wanted to run 18.75, just to hit an even 50. In the end, the conditions were enough that I stuck with 16. My cytomax started turning to sluch in my bottle before I got to mile 5, and by the time I turned around, it was almost entirely frozen solid. 

It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s only five weeks to race day. In Pfitzinger training plans, this would be the peak week, hitting 55 miles. My McMillan plan runs primarily by time, and I take off one day a week, otherwise I would have been up at 51-53. The miles aren&#8217;t quite as high as I&#8217;ve done in the past, but I definitely feel that the program is a good one. 

The other day I posted the pictures from the half marathon, where it appears I have some new muscle definition in my quads. My calves have been tightening up as well. My Mom said once that she&#8217;d heard people say someone LOOKED ready for a race. I feel that way: I feel myself growing lean and strong. Pushing through snow isn&#8217;t direct experience for what I&#8217;ll have on race day, but I will know what to do. 

Today&#8217;s run was a rough 16 in 2:34:34 (a 9:40 pace). I ran the last two miles in 8:47 and 8:35. I can keep going when it&#8217;s tough, and I can push when the time comes. 

Mile after mile, day after day. I know what I&#8217;m working towards. And just like when I trained for [Columbus &#8217;04](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2004/10/columbus-marathon-race-report-2/) with Boston dreams, and when I ran [Steamtown 05](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2005/10/steamtown-race-report/) with 3:30 aspirations, I know what will happen in just a few short weeks.
