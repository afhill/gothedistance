My mileage dropped pretty dramatically last week, from over 50mpw for a month down to 20. I&#8217;m taking some aggressive recovery from a minor hip flare-up. For some people, this sort of setback a week before a target race would be devastating. But I&#8217;m not too worried. In part, because of this:

[Reduction in corticospinal inhibition in the trained and untrained limb following unilateral leg strength training.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22200796)

What a huh? It&#8217;s a study I learned about on the Ben Greenfield Fitness Podcast. Basically they found that even if you&#8217;re injured, training one leg actually still helps with strength in the other. Basically, the body isn&#8217;t a bunch of individual limbs, there is some broader crossover in the body. 

Another study I heard about but can&#8217;t find right now deals with how doing some more anaerobic work can help your aerobic performance. For the past month, I&#8217;ve run a lot of miles, I HAVEN&#8217;T been doing a lot of power lifting or pushups or anything. But tapping into those systems can help come race day. So last week instead of pounding out more miles at sub-race pace, I was doing pushups and other exercises that got my heart rate up. I&#8217;ll need that come race day!

Lastly, I&#8217;ve been to yoga 4 times in the past 10 days. 4 times!! That&#8217;s a lot for me. But it&#8217;s been good both mentally and physically. It lets me honor my body and how it feels that day. I&#8217;ve noticed days when my hip and back are tight, or my balance is just &#8220;off&#8221;. This greater awareness and acceptance have helped me get ready for how things may or may not be on Sunday. I know I can run a lot of miles (34 marathons and counting &#8211; although I&#8217;ve been telling people it&#8217;s 35, whoops!). I know I am strong and can keep pushing through when I need it (crossfit taught me that &#8211; even if you&#8217;re down to a single handstand push-up at a time and need to take a break between them). 

One piece of the puzzle that&#8217;s been missing has been confidence and mental fortitude. Ok, so this week I started reading some &#8220;10 Minute Toughness&#8221; book on visualization and such. I&#8217;m just feeling ready for this one, despite the fact I&#8217;m not piling on a ton of last minute miles. I am fit and I&#8217;m not going to lose that fitness in a week. Rather, I&#8217;m going to line up at the start mentally and physically ready for what needs to happen.
