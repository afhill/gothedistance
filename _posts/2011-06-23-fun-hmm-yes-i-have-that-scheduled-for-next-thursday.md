I am a planner. I thrive on schedules and accountability. How many marathon training plans have I tried? I think the reason the TBT worked so well for me is because it was structured. Workout 5 days a week. Track food, eat 6ish times a day. Little steps you could check off the list. 

Part of the reason I&#8217;ve struggled with some of the marathons I&#8217;ve done is because I didn&#8217;t have a plan. Even now, I have a pretty serious running endeavor planned for August (a half marathon up a mountain on Saturday, a marathon up and down said mountain on Sunday), and I am NOT following any sort of regimented plan to prepare. 

Back when I was marathoning every month, I was able to leverage the training. Heck, one marathon was the &#8220;long run&#8221; for the next! However, I&#8217;m not in the same shape I was then. Sure, I&#8217;m in great shape, but it&#8217;s not endurance sports shape. 

Yesterday a dear friend posted that he&#8217;s committed to the Goofy Race and a Half Challenge in January. I know I&#8217;d have a blast seeing said friend, and we all know **I love a challenge!**. So I&#8217;m really tempted. But I KNOW I need to get serious and train for this stuff. Which means sitting down, devising a plan, and holding myself to it. 

I used a 3-day-a-week plan preparing for RnRAZ, and it worked pretty well. But that was before I was lifting like I am now. I need to sit down and figure out how all the pieces fit together. There are derby events nearly every weekend (whether or not I play is a question, but I can&#8217;t say yet), which obviously will impact my ability to do long runs on weekends. I simply need to figure out how to fit in the training for things that are important to me.
