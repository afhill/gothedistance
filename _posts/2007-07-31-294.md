Today was a very warm Recovery run &#8212; I wanted to be outside enjoying the temperature, but I can&#8217;t count how many times I had to stop to walk b/c my heart rate was too high. 

It&#8217;s really interesting to see how the workouts are going, especially as the same &#8216;types&#8217; of workouts are repeated. For example, I&#8217;ve had three recovery runs so far &#8212; runs o 4 or 5 miles where my garmin beeps at me if I go above 153bpm. 

two of the runs, I&#8217;ve done Friday mornings, and then today I ran at 2pm.  
10:28mm &#8211; avg HR147  
10:48mm &#8211; avg HR147  
11:30mm &#8211; avg HR146

I don&#8217;t know how finicky the garmin is in terms of beeping right at 153 or what, but I find it interesting that my average HR is pretty consistent, even as my pace changes. I know that the heat today played a major factor in the slower pace, but I will enjoy seeing how it may fluctuate as I go through my training cycle.

Yes, I have still hit every workout so far (I altered my scheduled to accomodate the race last Saturday from the outset). My progress is here: http://www.afhill.com/running/oct_pfitz2007.htm I&#8217;m embarrassed about the code &#8212; it was DW generated two years ago &#8212; but I am holding out for my flex app with backend integration.. now I just need the time to build it!
