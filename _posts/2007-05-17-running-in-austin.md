last week was a pretty good running week. I was in Austin Monday through Thursday, so I wanted to be sure to take some run to &#8216;run the sights&#8217;! Monday I arrived in town and did alot of walking around (Congress Ave), then headed to the St Edwards University campus. The conference I was in town for was held there, so I scoped out where I was to park the next morning, then ran around the campus for awhile. It was gorgeous out, warmer than I&#8217;m used to in Ohio! Around the soccer field there was a gravel path, so I looped it a few times. The first loop took me about 2.5 minutes, which had me wondering, was it really a quarter mile? As I ran around time and again, I chatted with a woman who was taking her mini dachshund Millie for a walk. She affirmed it was in fact a quarter mile, and I was reminded that the first few warm weather runs are bad!!! I&#8217;d thought I was running at a good clip, and it was actually 10 minute miles! Still, I got in 45 minutes, so I was happy with that! I stopped at the local food mart and picked up gatorade, water, OJ and limon chips, I&#8217;m sure the cashier was wondering about me!!

The conference was Tues/Wed so I didnt have much time to do anything, then Thursday morning I headed to Town Lake trail and ran for about an hour. I was actually turning 8:15 miles at the beginning, which I was pretty content with. Eventually, however, the mojitos from the night before and the lack of breakfast caught up with me and I slowed significantly. Still, I felt good!

Saturday I headed out to Antrim, wondering if anyone was going to show up. Brian and Mike thought the same thing ðŸ™‚ We ran a sub-8 pace for the first 7 miles, a &#8216;slow run&#8217; for Brian. Then we let him go off and Mike and I did one loop around the lake, for a total of 8.2 miles. I&#8217;ll admit, it was tough on me, my legs felt tired for the rest of the day, but dang it felt good!!!!

It sounds like the gang is running Steamtown this year, hurrah! I am eager to set out a training plan, I always do better when I have a plan&#8230;.
