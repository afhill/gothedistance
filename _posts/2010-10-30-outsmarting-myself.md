I started my training this week and for some reason jumped into week M-10. Then tonight (after one successful and one not successful workout) I took another look. Apparently, I&#8217;m 12 weeks out! So, I did the completely wrong workout, and I actually have a longer but slower run on the books the weekend. Guess I&#8217;m glad I figured it out now&#8230;
