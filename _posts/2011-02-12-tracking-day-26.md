First off.. A few folks have expressed quiet concern that my tracking may be a sign of too much of a fixation. I really really appreciate the sentiment. But we Hills tend to track things: my parents have years of golf scores, mom and I have our runs. It&#8217;s just what we do ðŸ™‚  
For me, the tracking is for observation. Right now with the livestrong site I&#8217;m focusing more on quantities just so I can see the breakdown, but it&#8217;s not affecting my behavior, it&#8217;s just so I can benchmark. 

Case in point: today&#8217;s breakfast ðŸ™‚ I made that healthy banana bread (and read afterwards how agave nectar is supposedly really bad for you), and then proceeded to eat like a third of it (it&#8217;s supposed to have 12 servings??) I&#8217;m not limiting myself to serving sizes, just keeping track of them. 

That being said&#8230; I did elect to go to a friends birthday late to miss the pizza and soda. Though when I arrived, it smelled dang good and I would have had some were it still available. It&#8217;s not that I care about the calories or anything: I just do believe that my body wants good healthy food. 

One very interesting observation I&#8217;ve had speaks to this: a few months ago I wrote something about my heartrate after a workout getting up really high, and Frida asked what my resting heart rate was. I checked the next morning and I don&#8217;t like I could get it lower than 68? (I don&#8217;t exactly recall). Well over the past 26 days I&#8217;ve stopped taking bazi (superfruit energy shot), most coffee and processed sugar. And today as I&#8217;m leisurely riding my bike (yes, leisurely, but still riding), my heart rate was down at 60. Wha?? How amazing is that. And revealing what those stimulants can do. 

Apart from riding 10 miles, I also went to Better Bodies and did shoulders and back. It felt great to be there. I realized that I feel much more successful when I do add sets, where you increase the weight with each set. I did some reading today that basically says the opposite (drop sets) are better for building muscle fast, but I feel like I tire too quickly and can&#8217;t do much. Interestingly, add sets stimulate your slow twitch fibers first, which seems to speak to the fact I&#8217;m a marathoner. We love our slow twitch fibers! So I&#8217;m not sure if I should stick with add sets or really try to step outside of whats comfortable. 

Had some good meals today: brown rice, tempeh and steamed spinach for lunch and pita pockets with brown rice, black beans, tomato, spinach and bean sprouts for dinner. I did have some salt water taffy at the party, to prove I&#8217;m human and not depriving myself of EVERYTHING ðŸ™‚

Tomorrow is the race! I keep forgetting ðŸ™‚
