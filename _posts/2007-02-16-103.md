I was emailing with my friend Andy today, and he asked how many marathons I&#8217;d run. I broke it out by year:

2004: 1  
2005: 5  
2006: 6 (+ 1 ultra)

His response was that I was set to run 11 this year.. or 12. I responded with &#8220;or 7&#8221;. Whoa guess that makes both of us big dorks, but what can you expect from two computer people? I then went on to say I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d even hit 100 miles this year thus far, so I wasn&#8217;t sure either of those were happening. He said he&#8217;d actually just hit 100 miles the day before. Well, of course I then had to go back and see what I was at.

January, I&#8217;d run 88 miles.  
Feb 2 &#8211; 8 miles  
Feb 3 &#8211; 7 miles  
&#8230;  
&#8230;

and that&#8217;s the last time I ran. So sure enough, I&#8217;ve passed the hundred mile mark, but not by much!

I did order TWO* pairs of shoes today, and I&#8217;m definitely planning to meet the gang tomorrow, so hopefully I can get back in the game.

<span style="color:#c03">*why two? because of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Womens-Grid-Moderate-Closeout/dp/B000BBS4UG">this fantabulous sale</a>. I know I like these shoes, and it gave me free shipping as well as a good price</span>
