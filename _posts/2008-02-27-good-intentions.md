I met Meredith today for our 12 miles outside. It seemed cold to start but we got used to it relatively quickly. Some snow fell today so we were literally sometimes in snow drifts half way up to our knees (we&#8217;re both short). After a tough 6.09 miles we were back at our cars, and decided not to try for the second half. I walked over to the track to see if it was any better, no luck. So we went our separate ways, and I planned to go home, grab some shorts and head to the gym for the last 6. But I had a VM from [roll:](http://www.roll-online.com), my bike was tuned-up and ready for me! So I went by the store, and I&#8217;m finally home, and not really eager to leave my nice warm house again. I&#8217;m telling myself that the hour+ since we stopped running would really mean that the two six mile runs wouldn&#8217;t be equivalent to a 12 miler anyway&#8230;

It&#8217;s too bad when it&#8217;s not lack of motivation, but circumstances, that get in your way.

at least the bike is here, I can use it as an excuse to watch the &#8220;Pussycat Girls present.. Girlicious&#8221; I DVRed on Monday&#8230;.
