On June 1st, I started a running streak and it&#8217;s been good to just get back accustomed to running again. There have certainly been days where it was solely the challenge that made me lace up those shoes and get out there. 

This week on the NYCM Facebook page they mentioned the race was 20 weeks away &#8211; wow! That helped me to focus a bit.. there&#8217;s also the slight matter of another [audacious 26.2 race](http://www.pikespeakmarathon.org/) before that! 

I recently came across my running journals from my first few big races and it was fun to reflect on how things were going. I want to get back into that habit.. so here goes! It won&#8217;t be the same as the chicken scrawl in my physical booklet but this way I know I can always look back at it. 

So how did my week go?

Monday 6/16: Was feeling pretty tired from my weekend in Portland, so I put in the bare minimum, 1 mile 

Tuesday: 6/17: Not really feeling super enthusiastic, ran around the neighborhood after work. 2.85 im 28min

Wednesday 6/18: Ran to Sloan&#8217;s Lake in the morning from work. 5.02 miles in 47 min

Thursday 6/19: I didnt realize it at the time, but this was my surgery anniversary! Did some &#8216;speedwork&#8217; on the treadmill, just trying to get my pace up around 7-8:30. 1 mile total

Friday 6/20: I slept in and planned to run after work. By that time it was 85-90 degrees &#8211; yuck! I drove home and waited for it to cool off, and then eventually ran out around Chautauqua. Need to get some trailwork in! 5.7miles in 1:08

Saturday 6/21: I wanted to get some good distance in, so I went out to the Coalton trail. I wanted to do the whole 14 mile loop (I generally go out 5 and turn around), so I made myself run with my heart rate monitor and try to stay under 153. It was definitely tough at some points, but I was glad I did it. The last mile I was definitely dragging (my right leg started to get sore, but I was really impressed it was fine until that last mile) but I felt like I lasted a lot longer since I held myself back. Watch died with about a mile to go, but I probably ran 14 miles in 2:35?

Sunday 6/22: I had been thinking by the end of Saturday&#8217;s run that I&#8217;d just do an easy mile on Sunday, but a few of my relay friends decided to get together for 6 miles in the morning. I felt pretty stiff when we started out, but warmed up. One of the gals had us walk a bit so we didnt get in a whole 6 miles of running. 5.7 miles in 59 min  
Note: when I was walking later in the afternoon I got a weird lock in the inside of my right knee and I couldnt put weight on the weight-bearing part. It made me VERY nervous as it reminded me of last year, but it was weird as it was really only off to the inside front of my knee. hopefully nothing, but I&#8217;ll pay attention to it. 

Total: 35 miles. Actually 35.27, which is kinda funny since two weeks ago I ran 34.74. I guess what they say about it all averaging out is true! I&#8217;m pretty happy with this mileage, AND how I feel. I&#8217;ll definitely listen to my body but overall I feel pretty good with how things are going. I am not yet ready to jump into an intense training plan but I like feeling like I&#8217;m working towards something. I was marveling that although I lost my speed, I feel pretty good in terms of overall muscle strength.
