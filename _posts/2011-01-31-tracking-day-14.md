Today I was really tired and had lots of cravings. Finally at 5 it hit me, I&#8217;m affected by changes in barometric pressure. Usually I get wicked headaches, a little sleepiness and a craving for chocolate ain&#8217;t too bad! While I start to get headache around 10:30pm, it wasn&#8217;t near as debilitating as normal.

Tonight&#8217;s culinary adventure was spelt muffins. I&#8217;m not really clear on what flour is good and my inner carboholic was calling out, so I made my own muffins! I used kefir in place of milk, since I didn&#8217;t have any milk in the house. They actually turned out all right!

The other day I bought a rice cooker-slash-steamer, which is why every dinner lately has included some steamed veggies. Super simple and tasty. 

I started the day with some good work on my arms, and a little on my back. I typically haven&#8217;t done much backwork, but I suspect it could help me with my sore shoulders and neck.
