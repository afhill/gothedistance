I&#8217;m still not feeling 100%, but I&#8217;m glad yesterday&#8217;s crazy scrimmages didn&#8217;t seem to set me back. I actually woke up before my alarm, and decided I wanted to go for an easy run. Racing always helps me rekindle my love of running!  
I found out that Team Canada Roller Derby World Cup tryouts are July 3rd in Calgary: where my brother lives and about 3 hours from where my folks live. So I decided I&#8217;d go home over the long weekend.. and right after I mentioned it to my folks, my Mom asked me if I wanted to run a 15K race on the 1st. Like mother, like daughter I guess &#8211; of course I would! So even before I&#8217;m officially registered for the tryouts, I have a race on my schedule!
