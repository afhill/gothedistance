Amazing derby photographer Axle Adams was at the bout over the weekend and took a [fun photo of the Bruising jammers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/type2b/5628452462/in/photostream#/) (we&#8217;re so intimidating!)

BUT&#8230; I noticed that my arms didn&#8217;t look as good as I felt they should. So I pulled up my 30 day pics, and I definitely think I&#8217;m losing definition :-((

This is a bit of a disappointment. I have been steadily going along this program but I feel like this is already a slide in the wrong direction? I don&#8217;t know that I want to go crazy and pump up my arm workouts like mad, but I don&#8217;t want to lose the gains I saw early on?? üôÅ

Hopefully this creatine will help.. wonder if I just need to eat more? 

**EDIT: ok, so a few of my facebook friends blamed the lighting on the difference, which made me feel better. So when I got home I took a new photo with the same lighting as the 30 day. Ok, I&#8217;m happier now (although it is a great lesson on how they may do some of those before and after shots&#8230;.)**
