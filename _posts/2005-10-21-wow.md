Today was my last run before Detroit (my first since Columbus). It was also at the end of a 50+ hr workweek. It was a bit chilly and rainy, but it was perfect. I was supposed to run with Cheryl but she wimped out and went to the gym, so I ended up at Antrim. As soon as I started running, a large grin spread over my face. It was great running weather. I&#8217;m Canadian, I find it envirogating to get that slight hint of mist when you breathe out. There were few hardy souls on the trail, so I was really able to appreciate it. I had to hold myself back from running too fast, it just felt great. I placated myself with a few fartleks, but it wasn&#8217;t hard to imagine a strong run again this week. Oh, how I&#8217;d love to better my Steamtown time. I guess we&#8217;ll see!
