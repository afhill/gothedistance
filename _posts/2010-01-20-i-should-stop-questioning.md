Today was our first scrimmage of the new derby season. Scrimmage practices are held every Wednesday. We get into our teams (everyone cleared for scrimmage is drafted to one of three home teams) and play three periods of derby just like a real game, with refs calling points and penalites. Often, our announcers are on hand as well. The last half hour is the toughest, where our nationally-ranked travel team plays against everyone else! 

Because the season just started up again, the turnout was a bit low. I was one of two primary jammers for most of the night. I actually felt great! Quick on my feet and pretty strong. I got quite a few complements from folks as well, so it&#8217;s not just my ego talking. I shrugged it off, saying my skates and new wheels were making the difference. 

But really, the last two blog posts I&#8217;ve had have been about great athletic achievements: feeling strong and powerful with plenty of energy. Even when I go for a short run around my neighborhood, I have more energy and pickup than I have since I arrived in Colorado. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve hit a whole new level. 

I could look for explanations, sure. but why? There are a few changes I&#8217;ve made, and any or all of the may account for the success I&#8217;m feeling these days. Or I could just give myself some credit, and appreciate how things are going.
