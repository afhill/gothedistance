So today was my first week of marathon training for New York. It feels so great to be able to say that again! I decided to go with the [Hal Higdon Novice 2 plan](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51138/Marathon-Novice-2-Training-Program). I&#8217;m pretty confident I followed his intermediate plan when I trained for my FIRST marathon, but oh well! I wanted to feel good about this plan and not get discouraged. 

With starting this plan, I decided to end my run streak. I wanted to have a better plan to try to follow rather than just potentially doing the bare minimum of a mile a day. 

I decided this on a Tuesday night, so my plan was already a bit weird to start. The week&#8217;s runs were:

Tues: 3 miles  
Wed: 5 miles at marathon pace  
Thurs: 3 miles  
Sat: 8 miles

So probably unlike many others taking on the marathon challenge, I&#8217;m not really worried about the distance / mileage. I more need to work on my speed. My goal place for NYCM as it stands now is an 8mm &#8211; I&#8217;d like to run a 3:30. I totally reserve the right to change that as we get closer but considering I ran 3:30:05 in only my third marathon back in 2005 and my PR is 3:09 (7:15 pace), I&#8217;d love to think I can whip myself back into that shape. 

Why did I give that little aside on pace? Because you&#8217;ll notice that from the very first week of this plan, they expect you to be able to run 5 miles at marathon pace. This totally psyched me out and caused me to try to put that run off as much as I could. I was going to try on a treadmill &#8211; except wait, treadmills are horrible. Ugh! I even considered signing up for a July 4th race at the last minute just to try to trick myself into it. 

Ok &#8211; so maybe SPEED isn&#8217;t the biggest challenge I have to face. Maybe it&#8217;s MY HEAD. Without even trying to run that pace now (and considering that I have 18 weeks to get there), I was already telling myself that heck, a 3:40 marathon (BQ) was an awesome goal! 

I did get in the two three milers just fine &#8211; On Wed I ran the three miles at work at an 8:33 pace and on Fri I ran them in the evening at home at an 8:59 pace. These were both runs where I didnt have target paces, but I still saw them as training runs and didnt want to just slog through them. Note &#8211; I also hiked Fri morning as well. 

Finally on Saturday I knew I had to try for this speedwork. So I compromised: go to the track (nice and flat) and do intervals. I set up a workout on Garmin connect to do a warmup, then 5x1mi between 7:55 &#8211; 8:35 with a minute recovery, then a cooldown. I slept in so I didnt get to the track til 9, and it was already toasty. Then I realized my workout hadnt transferred to my watch! So I spent some time trying to repost it, and ended up giving myself 2 min recovery between each set AND didnt even set a goal pace so I had to keep glancing at my watch anyway. What a waste&#8230;.

It was HOT so I tended to walk to the water fountain and get water during my recovery, which often stretched beyond two min. But I told myself what was important was the fast stuff. 

And &#8211; I did ok! I kept starting too fast and then forcing myself closer to my target speed. Then after the first loop a couple people joined me on the track which bugged me a bit &#8211; I&#8217;d speed up to pass them (because they were on the inside lane) but then I&#8217;d be gonig too fast and feel embarrassed slowing down right afterwards. So, I went faster than I should have.  
And then I decided only to do 3 of the 5 intervals.  
But, I still think it was a great start to my speedwork. Remember my goal time of 8MM, but I was worried I&#8217;d have to be slower b/c I wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep it up? I did the intervals in 7:52, 7:46, and 7:52. Nice! 

Then today (Sunday) I ran the Summer Roundup 12K down by Colorado Springs. It was also HOT. The course was mostly trail and there was a fair amount of rolling. It was kinda tough! The worst part was that I got some bad stomach cramps about halfway through. I had taken an electrolyte capsule before, so I don&#8217;t know if that was part of it? But I walked for awhile to try to feel better. It was kinda a bummer, but I was still SO glad I got out there and did it. 

I realized during the race that I felt &#8211; fine. Ok, out of shape, but my knee and leg were just fine. That was a big relief and it definitely helps me feel like a real runner again. No more limping (that I can tell). And I feel like I can comfortably start doing some real strength training and such, I dont need to baby my leg anymore. I&#8217;m so thankful! (I actually noticed this a bit earlier in the week when I did my first few jump lunges since the surgery)  
In the end I covered the 12K in 1:11:46, for 11th in my age group out of 36. It&#8217;s a far cry from my results from a few years ago, but at least there are results! 

So, week 1 is in the books! I got so excited after the race today (AND apprehensive about Pikes Peak in just over a month) that I signed up for the Barr Trail Mountain Race next weekend. Yup, the runner Andrea is back!
