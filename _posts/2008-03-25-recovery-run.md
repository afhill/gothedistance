So a few years ago I determined that 153/156 was my recovery run pace &#8212; I think it&#8217;s 156 in the summer when it&#8217;s warm out. Today I went out for an easy run and came back with an average 156 heart rate. Cool, a recovery run without intending for it to be. The kicker? It was at a 9:13 pace! Often for me to do a recovery run (granted, that&#8217;s for a 153 heart rate), I need to be close to an 11 minute mile. 

Obviously, all is well!
