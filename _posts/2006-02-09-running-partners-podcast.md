I started listening to the irunningradio.com podcast the other week. Today I listened to Episode 11 on running partners, and it really struck a chord.

_[Episode 11](http://irunningradio.com/podcast/irunningradio_11_020506.mp3) &#8211; 2/05/06 &#8211; Running Partners &#8211; Bonnie and Jim discuss what to look for in a having a Runner Partner and how it is a key to running success. Special Guest: Kathy Jensen._

The podcast talked about how we may form a close bond with our running partners, and how it can sometimes seem easier to open up and share with someone as we run. It also talked about how that relationship can develop from just running partners into a close friendship. It definitely caused me to think about my running buddies, and think about how much they mean to me.

When I moved here, I ran with Tara and John a few times a week. John was very different from us in terms of his stage of life, political background, etc. But for a few days a week, we met and enjoyed each others&#8217; company. My first out-of-state race was when we went to Indy &#8212; still one of my cherished running memories.  
Through Tara, I met Andy Diamond, Mike, Bridget and I think Doug? As well as a few other Nationwiders. We&#8217;d meet with them the ocassional Saturday and Wednesday, but at that point they were just people to train with. I quit running for about a year and a half, and emailed Andy out of the blue and asked if they were still running on Saturdays. I&#8217;ve met up with that group almost every weekend since then (August, 2004).

I&#8217;m an honorary member of the Nationwide Running Group, and I adore it. Whereas back in 2002 we&#8217;d meet them to run, then go our separate ways, now on those cold days I think I enjoy the hot chocolate at Panera as much as I like the running itself! The trips we&#8217;ve taken to Boston, South Bend, and Portland have been great. There have been parties and dinners. We&#8217;re training partners, but we&#8217;re more than that. It&#8217;s great to check in with people and get to know them on a more personal basis. I don&#8217;t generally exchange gifts at Christmas, but my friend Doug and I swapped magazine subscription much like we swap stories of what&#8217;s going on with our lives. I&#8217;m a single cat owner, he and his wife have a Brady Bunch family of 6 kids, with several of them college-aged. We&#8217;re in completely different places, yet we&#8217;re friends.

In contrast to my training buddies, there are Paul and Helen. Also Nationwiders, but they&#8217;re not training buddies. They&#8217;re race buddies! I&#8217;ve seen Helen on one training run, but we&#8217;re always up for a race (especially if it involves travelling!) The funny thing is, we don&#8217;t run together. We just plan and travel together. But it&#8217;s great fun to share our war stories after.

Another race buddy is Bob &#8211; but we don&#8217;t train together b/c we don&#8217;t live in the same state. We met on some online forums and Boston will be the 4th race we&#8217;ve both run. We met in person the first time in Steamtown. We actually ran the Disney half together, and we both ran the full the following day. Now we will both be doing Boston. He also has a few other friends that have done these races as well, and we all get together the afternoon of the race to talk. I spend a fair amount of time on the forums, but I definitely think there is something different when you meet someone in person, particularly if you do actually run together. 

So those are some of my cherished running partners and friends.
