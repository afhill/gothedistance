I think Disney will turn out well for me.. I ran a good 17 today, despite racing yesterday (and not properly fueling last night)

17 miles at Antrim: I wanted to run the latter part at MP + 10%, or 8:48. As it turned out, the entire run was like that.  
Did one loop of 5, one of 7, one of 5. Had a couple brief water stops but in general ran pretty smoothly. The last mile I was hurting, but I held on &#8211; I just wish I&#8217;d held back a bit at the middle for the end to be stronger.
