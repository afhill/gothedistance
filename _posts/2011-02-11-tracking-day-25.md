This morning I got up and did ab work, then ate breakfast before heading to PT. I was really thirsty, and actually felt pretty woozy and out of it during the electrstimulation. So, I decided I needed to eat more! He also noted I was a bit stiffer than I have been, and my bursa was a bit swollen üôÅ however, he didn&#8217;t seem too concerned and told me I&#8217;m ok to run the 5k Sunday: just to ice after. 

I had &#8220;second breakfast&#8221; around 9:30- egg whites, some light havarti cheese and hemp seeds in a pita. I threw some cottage cheese on there are well, not sure how I felt about that. Later in the morning I also had some odwalla superfood drink. This was the first juice I&#8217;ve had since I started tracking, I&#8217;ve been really good at not drinking calories but this is totally worth it to me! 

Within an hour I had a banana, and then succumbed to my boss&#8217; plentiful M&M dispenser during a meeting. I savored 10 whole pieces, and it really was a treat. 

For Lunch I had brown rice and asparagus, then through the afternoon I had cheese and lentil chips, and Greek yogurt with hemp seed and granola. 

After work I went to bootcamp, which was less strenuous as usual. Then I had some falafel chips with green pea guac and a spelt muffin. Finally for &#8220;dinner&#8221; I had some beet borcht. 

Tracking on livestrong, today was one of the first days I got close to the net 2K calories (I think it&#8217;s net?) it recommends. And I felt like I ate and ate and ate! I just had so much energy at bootcamp, it feels so good to have &#8220;clean fuel&#8221;.
