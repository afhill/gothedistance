I always manage to hit my knees as I lift at crossfit (possibly because I do stiff-legged deadlifts at the gym so my knees are safely away?). However, there were only 3 of us in the class so I asked for pointers. As we got to the AMRAP, I found myself doing stiff-legged deadlifts. I know the point is not to so that you are using your legs more to help, but it was easier for me (given we were doing a lighter weight). Still managed to beat myself up reasonably well.. So much for wearing a dress to my grad school reception tonight!

Initially for the 3&#215;3 I worked up to 120#, and it didn&#8217;t feel too bad at all. I wonder if I could have done more but I wanted to be strong for the main part of the workout. 

Then for the actual workout I dropped down to 55# (I think) &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t as hard as it could have been (he said to be at a 6 of 10) but I wasn&#8217;t sure if my knees wanted me to be doing too many heavy squats. The coach actually said he thought the front squats would be the limiting factor, weight-wise.

We started out and it went ok. I really got into a groove with my deadlifts and the squats weren&#8217;t bad although I felt myself using my right leg more to push up. The weak part of the set for me was definitely the power clean. My grip was getting pretty weak by the end, and it&#8217;s just not a movement I&#8217;m used to yet. I also managed to clip myself in the chin once, oops! 

In all, I got through 7+21 &#8211; that&#8217;s 7 full rounds, 10 deadlifts, 10 power cleans and 1 squat.

When we finished, I didn&#8217;t even want to reach up to put my sweatshirt on. Great workout!
