Met the gang this morning for a wet icky run.There were only a handful of us, and Mike bailed before we even started (it was supposedly 39F, but raining). I had worn shorts, concentrating on the 39 rather than the rain. It was cold and the raindrops pelted us in the face. There was Bob, Big Jelly, Doug, one other guy and myself. We started out, and within the first half mile there was a spot on the trail where a puddle had formed. I waited for everyone to pass, then had to push it a little to catch up to Doug. Even that little push caused a twinge in my hamstring. It was pretty darned easy to decide to turn around. I had actually woken up to sore knees this morning (I think the rain has something to do with it), and this group was definitely planning on a faster speed than I was prepared for. So I bailed. My plan is to load up my mp3 player with a book (I&#8217;m finishing &#8220;busting vegas&#8221; and just downloaded&#8221;my friend Leonard&#8221; and hit the gym for an easy \*gulp\* 14 later on this afternoon. My legs were glowing red as I got back in the car. Yuck!

But yeah. I need to work on some speed. There&#8217;s no LT run on the training schedule for this upcoming week so I may try to sub in the one I missed this week. Generally I don&#8217;t like to mess that much with the schedules since they&#8217;re prepared that way for a reason, but really I already to mess it up by not doing the run last weekend.
