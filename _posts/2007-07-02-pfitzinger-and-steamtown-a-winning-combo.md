Ok, the training plan is all set up: 

http://www.afhill.com/running/oct_pfitz2007.htm

I have a few races in there, I expect to add a few more. As well, the weekend prior to training starting is the Columbus Running Company One Mile Dash, I want to take part in that. 

Training paces:  
Marathon goal pace: based on 3:23:00 (7:47)  
Half-marathon goal pace: based on 1:37:00 (7:24)  
5K pace: based on current PR 21:55 (7:04)

How did I come up with those numbers? NYCM qualifying times, baby! I will be completely honest and state that I do NOT plan to run 3:23 in the marathon &#8212; I hope to qualify with a half. That being said, my improvement in the half marathon from my first to my PR is only about a minute (1:42:38 to 1:41:55) whereas my marathon has improved from 3:38:39 up to 3:29:41. I wonder if my strengths lie in the longer distances. 

Ok, off to bed, for tomorrow I try out the garmin for the first time!!
