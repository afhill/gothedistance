I don&#8217;t recall the first time I heard about [Fat Head](http://www.fathead-movie.com), a movie that claims that you \*can\* lose weight on a fast-food based high fat diet. 



I was a bit put off by the concept, and never put too much stock in it. But I was actually really impressed when I heard an interview with the filmmaker on [Ben Greenfield Fitness](http://www.bengreenfieldfitness.com/2011/10/why-fat-is-good/). This wasn&#8217;t some lazy slob who just wanted to eat his McDonalds in peace, he had some good strong scientific backing to his theory and approach. I decided to watch it and see for myself. 

The film is available for [free viewing via Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/196879/fat-head), which is nice and convenient. 

I think every good documentary must need a villain, and Tom Naughten picked a few. Morgan Spurlock, the [Center for Science in the Public Interest](http://www.cspinet.org/) and vigilante vegetarians. Obviously, the last one rubbed me the wrong way&#8230;

The premise of the film is simple: he ate fast food for 28 days, and he lost weight and improved other health indicators (body fat percentage, cholesterol). It would be one thing if we just saw the results. But Naughten actually did a great job at explaining the why behind what he was doing. He walked us through some history of nutrition and changing &#8216;recommended guidelines&#8217; (namely, we used to think saturated fats were evil, so trans fats were introduced. Now we believe trans fats are the real bad guys). An animated sequence explained how insulin interacts with fat cells, and the concept of the glycemic index was introduced. 

I can&#8217;t begin to discuss all the points that were raised, but there was one thing I&#8217;ve never really thought about: vegetable oils. How do you get vegetable oil? if you squeeze corn, you don&#8217;t get oil. It needs to be chemically extracted. So why do we think that&#8217;s natural food that our body knows how to process? Contrast that to animal fats, which we&#8217;ve been consuming for a long time. (This is where the contempt towards vegetarians comes in. Ugh). 

Despite a few rough edges, I actually quite enjoyed the movie. He advocates personal responsibility, which I obviously agree with. The film starts with his loitering outside a McDonalds, waiting for people to drag him in and force feed him poor food. It never happens ðŸ™‚ However, his discussion of the questionable science we&#8217;ve been fed raises a bit of concern. Does the general public care enough to become informed, or do we in fact need some guidance in doing what&#8217;s right?
