The great thing with a 3-day-a-week program is that every day is important. The challenging thing with a 3-day-a-week program is that every day is important. 

I&#8217;ve set my schedule to do speed on Tuesday, tempo on Thursday and long runs on Saturday. Because of the intensity of the workouts, the recovery days are essential. 

Last night at roller derby I fell on my left knee, which is already my weak point. This morning it&#8217;s still swollen and sore to bend, so obviously the tempo run didn&#8217;t happen this morning. But I can&#8217;t just shift it to tomorrow, or risk not having the strength for my long run Saturday (assuming of course my knee will be better by tomorrow anyway). 

I suppose with any decent training plan, every workout has purpose and needs to happen. It just seems with fewer actual days of running, that each one seems even more significant.
