Leg 27 &#8211; 5.9m: 45.xx (between 7:38 and 7:48 pace) &#8211; passed 18 runners, passed by 1

Average pace overall: 7:34 for 18.34 miles.

Our team finished the 197 miles in 25 hrs, 15 min, 6 sec, at an average pace of 7:42. That was 25 /140 in our division &#8211; men&#8217;s corporate open, despite the fact we had 6 women on our team (there is no mixed open). The other Nationwide team finished in 25:47:xx. Both teams had had projected finish times around 26:44, so we really outdid ourselves![<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/2005_Oregon_021-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Hood to Coast 2005" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1276" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/2005_Oregon_021.jpg)
