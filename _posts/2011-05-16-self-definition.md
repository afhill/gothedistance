I&#8217;m a marathoner. 26.2 is the sticker on my car, and the inspiration for my derby number. I&#8217;m sitting at 30 on my race resume, I&#8217;ve run Boston on four separate occasions (and qualified plenty of other times). It&#8217;s how I define myself. 

But I only ran two marathons in 2010, and haven&#8217;t cracked the distance yet this year. 

I know someone running in the Olympic trials in Houston, and a group is going to support her. I debated if I should register for the marathon or just the half, and in the end, I registered for the half. It&#8217;s easier to train for (duh, I just ran one yesterday in the middle of a bootcamp with little training), easier to recover from, and lets me focus more on my speed. 

But it&#8217;s not my distance. Speed isn&#8217;t the same challenge.. though it&#8217;s a good one. I told myself I was going to do shorter races this year and my injuries have forced me not to race as much as I could, but it feels like quitting.

Well.. not quitting because that&#8217;s a quick, final thing. It feels like I&#8217;m slowly deflating a balloon and I&#8217;m caught between letting that happen, and trying to rush to salvage any buoyancy that is left. 

I was talking to an instructor at the gym today: she asked if I was sore from the half yesterday. I said no, because I generally did marathons. We talked about the challenge of training for marathons, and I recalled how when I was doing a race once a month, I was steady in my fitness and didn&#8217;t need to &#8220;train&#8221;. It already feels like that is so far beyond where I am now, part of me fears that it&#8217;d be a long road back to the person I still see myself as. And I&#8217;m not sure yet I know who I&#8217;d want to replace that person with.
