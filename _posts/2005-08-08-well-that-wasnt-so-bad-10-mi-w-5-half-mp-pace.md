Just got back from my 10 miler at Antrim &#8211; 87F. Yuck! I decided to do 3 miles warm-up, 5 @ half-MP (~7:48), then 2 miles cool-down. And it worked out just fine!

01: 8:16 (a bit short)  
02: 8:46  
03: 8:56  
&#8211;water break&#8211;  
04: 7:23 (was at 3:33 at the half-mile, then saw Helen so stopped to chat for a bit)  
05: 7:27  
&#8211;stopped to catch breath for a minute&#8211; (40:51 at halfway mark)  
06: 7:39  
07: 7:33  
&#8211;water break&#8211;  
08: 7:49  
09: 8:51  
10: 8:21  
Finish: 1:21:06 (Avg pace 8:06; middle 5 @ 7:36)

Overall, I was pretty happy, especially considering the heat. I was dragging pretty bad in mile 9, but I stayed at sub-9, so I&#8217;m pretty happy. I was a bit surprised I pushed the middle 5 miles, and I wonder if that made the last miles alot tougher, or if perhaps my half marathon pace is a bit soft ðŸ™‚

As an aside, I feel like I just can&#8217;t get hydrated! Other than a cup of coffee in the morning, all I drink is water and gatorade, and my tongue still has those little dehydration puckers on it! Yuck!
