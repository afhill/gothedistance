While I&#8217;m not posting daily food and exercise logs, I&#8217;m definitely playing around in the kitchen a lot. Here are some things I&#8217;ve made as of late (so I can find them later!)

[Black bean and quinoa burgers](http://vegweb.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=59d3f60985de2fbf9e7c7e3dbddd9fb1&topic=39727.0) &#8211; surprisingly easy to make!

[Beet and hemp granola](http://www.choosingraw.com/thursday-night-express-post-beet-and-hemp-granola-nutrient-packed-and-high-raw/) &#8211; although I no longer eat Greek Yogurt and have less of a need for granola, this intrigued me with its bright color. (One of two pink foods I made this week &#8211; I also made [very berry chia hemp pudding](http://www.choosingraw.com/recipes/very-berry-chia-hemp-pudding/))

[Southwestern quinoa salad](http://www.mykitchenaddiction.com/2011/04/southwest-quinoa-salad/)

[Coconut tofu with sweet chili sauce](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1aypajaud9abv0YxB22lYnZV81g5lYuVqKfNRP717wZw)

[Chana Masala (Spicy Chickpeas with Spinach)](http://www.food.com/recipe/chana-masala-spicy-chickpeas-with-spinach-235680).
