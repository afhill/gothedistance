Of the 30 day wii challenge, day 3 is a rest day! Went to PT this morning. He had me do single knee squats, which hurt my left knee. He pushed on the inside of the knee to support it, and had me try again; I couldn&#8217;t. He said that was related to my hip problems; I&#8217;ve been overcompensating for years. So glad I&#8217;m getting this all worked out!
