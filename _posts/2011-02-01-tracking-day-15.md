Today I did wii active, went to pt, lead league derby practice and attended bruising practice. I&#8217;m aware that my skating is exacerbating my crazy leg angle; will have to figure that out.  
The biggest news is that my PT said &#8220;you haven&#8217;t asked me when you can start running again&#8221;. He said maybe this weekend! 

One of my teammates brought cupcakes to practice.. It was a long night and I was terribly tempted, but I resisted!
