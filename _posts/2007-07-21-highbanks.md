I still don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m glad I wore my garmin to Highbanks. We have ALWAYS called it a 6 mile loop, even if we knew that wasn&#8217;t really accurate. It seems to be about 5.5/5.6, so what we&#8217;d usually consider a 12 mile run was really only 11.08. I had 13 on my training schedule, so Doug and I dragged ourselves out for another little bit to get it exactly right.

13miles at Highbanks: 2:00:20 (9:13mm). 

When we got to the big hill on the first loop, I said I was going to try to hammer it up the hill to see how high I could get my heartrate. Yeah, bad idea. I didnt even make it up halfway before I stopped to walk. So the search for the max heart rate continues! 

As we started the second loop, I felt a little something on my toes of my left foot. I was wearing some smartwool socks for the first time, so I had trouble believing I&#8217;d rubbed a hole in them. We stopped for a brief water stop during the second loop, and I took off my shoe. Oh, hello blood. I had trimmed my toenails before the run and evidently I hadn&#8217;t filed one well, and it had torn the side of my toe a little. No pain at all, but the blood was making my sock feel weird. It made me remember the days of blisters &#8212; I&#8217;m so glad not to have those same problems anymore. 

First week of training is done! Feeling good so far, ha!
