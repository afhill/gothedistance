What a week! It was hectic, and while I thoroughly enjoyed parts of it, it wasn&#8217;t exactly a stellar week for training.

Good:  
I hit the gym 3 days: legs on Monday, chest on Tuesday, back and biceps on Sunday.  
I spent several days at [Mayacamas Ranch](http://www.mayacamasranch.com/), a retreat center in California. It was pretty and relaxing, and I got a LOT of sleep!  
I also spent some good time with friends  
The food at Mayacamas was tasty and quite healthy!  
I did get a couple short hikes in (i.e. a mile each)

The Less-Good  
I ate a LOT &#8211; as in, I gained 4 pounds this week, Not that I really care, but come on, that&#8217;s a bit ridiculous  
I only ran 3 days &#8211; I&#8217;d planned to run at the retreat center but the paths weren&#8217;t runnable  
I drank&#8230;um&#8230;.Tues, Wed, Thurs and Sat. Not a ton &#8211; Tuesday was one margarita &#8211; but it&#8217;s more alcohol than I&#8217;ve consumed in a long time  
I honestly think I ate more chocolate at a party on Saturday than I have all year  
I missed my long run for the week  
I only logged 20 miles this week!

I could have done the long run today &#8211; I also could have run on the road at Mayacamas &#8211; but I chose not to. I sorta sabotaged myself, not eating well and then not feeling prepared to do the miles I should be. Houston is in just over a month! 

I&#8217;m going to be careful not to let this bug me too much. I had an off week &#8211; but it&#8217;s only a week, and it&#8217;s just nicely far enough away from race day that I will have a few more solid weeks of training to feel confident come race day. 

I&#8217;d like to believe that maybe my body really needed this off time and I&#8217;ll be stronger for it, but I can&#8217;t quite go that far. I wanted to run today, but I didn&#8217;t fuel properly yesterday and I didnt feel emotionally prepared for the run. I tried to listen to the [Ben Greenfield Fitness podcast](http://www.bengreenfieldfitness.com/) but honestly, I just don&#8217;t do well listening to something while I run. It prevents me from getting &#8220;in the zone&#8221;. I can talk with people, sure, but having something going in my ear seems to just make me anxious.

This upcoming week will already be better: I have running plans for tomorrow morning, Tuesday night, and likely Wednesday night. I did a huge shopping trip to Whole Foods and can fuel myself appropriately (the challenge with being on the road is that I eat a lot because I don&#8217;t know when the next meal will come or what it will be). I did lift tonight which makes me feel more focused and calm, and ready to get back on track.
