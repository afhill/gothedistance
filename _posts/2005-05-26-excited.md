I read the RunnersWorld forums alot, and it seems over and over people who run two marathons in quick succession (6-8 weeks) do really well the 2nd time. I guess it&#8217;s true that you&#8217;ve got very strong training behind you. I&#8217;m getting pretty excited about SunBurst next weekend &#8211; I&#8217;ve been telling myself I want to run 3:35, but maybe &#8212; just maybe &#8212; I can kick it up a bit more than that? Last year a 3:40 would have placed me in the top 10 for females, and b/c there is a turn-around at mile 16.5, I&#8217;ll be able to see how I&#8217;m faring. Should be good!
