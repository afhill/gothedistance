Poor Jeff Galloway. He doesn&#8217;t get much respect from runners, with his &#8220;Gallowalking&#8221; technique. Yet today I came across a blog by [Will Marquardt](http://longrunsolutions.typepad.com/), who recently set a 21 minute PR! I was curious how he did it, and as I read through his blog I saw he was putting in some LONG runs (up to 29 miles). And then I came across something I didn&#8217;t expect: [Speed By Galloway](http://longrunsolutions.typepad.com/long_run_solutions/2008/01/speed-by-gallow.html). Yes, Will has been following a Galloway plan, and it&#8217;s obviously working for him!

People generally associate Galloway with walk breaks, which tends to make them think that the overall pace must be slower. I know I&#8217;ve had some success with walking water stops, so I&#8217;m not completely adverse to the idea of letting your heart rate go down, etc. But I&#8217;m really impressed by Will&#8217;s PR of 3:22, with or without walk breaks (I&#8217;ve logged a comment asking him if he takes them or not). 

As I close in on marathon #20, I find that I like to mix it up a little. That may mean running a different style of race than I&#8217;m used to, it may mean training differently. I wouldn&#8217;t be adverse to giving a Galloway plan a try, if it&#8217;s working for others&#8230;
