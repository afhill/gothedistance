today I ran [marathon #14](http://www.afhill.com/running/races.html)&#8230; (my 15th race of 26.2+ &#8212; see my stats at the [marathon maniacs](http://mm.littlemarathon.com/MyMarathons.asp?ManiacId=194) site) it was another warm day, but I finished in a respectable 3:38:21. It was a good run, while I felt a bit tired, my head was in it the whole way. It&#8217;s so interesting that after 4 years of this stuff, I still love the experience&#8230; I anticipate doing it for a long time to come..

Well, I hope so! Vegas and Boston are on the calendar, and a friend just mentioned Napa Valley..
