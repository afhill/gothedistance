&#8220;It will always be the sport, the Marathon, that we protect and defend. For without the integrity of our sport, our labor/training is fruitless, our rewards and recognitions are successless, our dreams are meaningless.&#8221;  
&#8211; Rick Nealis, Marine Corps Marathon Race Director, in a response to allegations of charity runners &#8216;cheating&#8217; at the MCM&#8217;05.
