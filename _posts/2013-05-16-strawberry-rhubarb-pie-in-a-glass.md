Ok, so it&#8217;s just a smoothie, but doesn&#8217;t it sound intriguing?

Strawberry-rhubarb pie has always been one of my favorites. But, I don&#8217;t really eat pie anymore, so it&#8217;s been awhile since I enjoyed this flavor combination. Yesterday I saw rhubarb at the grocery story, and decided to try my own version&#8230;

Yes, thanks to the Vitamix I just drank my favorite childhood pie!

Surprisingly the dates gave it enough sweetener I didn&#8217;t need anything else to cut the bitter rhubarb flavor. I was impressed!
