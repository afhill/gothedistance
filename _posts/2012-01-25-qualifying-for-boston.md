I was fortunate enough to run a BQ time in my first attempt at the 26.2 distance. At that time, my qualifying time was 3:40:59 and I ran 3:38:39. For men 18-34, the qualifying time was 3:10:59.

I then ran the Boston marathon 4 times, in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009. By 2009, the novelty had worn off and I&#8217;m no longer terribly interested in running the race again. However, the qualifying time remains a good indicator. 

In February 2011, the B.A.A. announced they would be [tightening up the qualifying times](http://www.baa.org/news-and-press/news-listing/2011/february/boston-athletic-association-announces-new-registration-process.aspx). The new time for females 18-34 would be 3:35:00, and for males 18-34 it would go up to 3:05:00. 

I know very well that non-runners often don&#8217;t have a good sense of really how fast these paces are. My cabbie to the Houston airport asked how I did, and when I said I&#8217;d done well, he asked if I&#8217;d managed to break 4 hours. For him, that was a great marathon time.

In trying to explain really how fast 3:09:52 was, I mentioned to a friend that &#8220;a year ago, that would have been a men&#8217;s BQ time&#8221;. Ugh, that year ago disclaimer weakened the message a bit. 

And then this morning, I had a thought. I keep getting older&#8230;.

And yes, sure enough, as I crest into a more mature age category, my time would even earn a dude a BQ for the 2013 race.

When I first started doing marathons, I remember saying to Andy that I wanted to run a men&#8217;s qualifying time. I&#8217;ve always felt the women&#8217;s times were a bit soft. How cool that even with their more rigid standards, I met that goal! I guess aging isn&#8217;t all that bad ðŸ˜‰
