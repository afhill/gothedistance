A big group of us met this morning in place of our normal Saturday morning group. I guess it makes sense as most of them are NW employees, and they got today off. I showed up to meet Mike, and there was Andy, Jen, Doug, Bridget, Brian, Mike and Rich. We set out, it was perfect weather. I started at the back of the pack, then steadily picked it up. Ended up running alot with Bridget, and when we got back to Antrim (6.5 miles in), we just kept going.. (often the group stops for a few minutes). We kept running and running, and it was really nice. We chatted away, and it really made the time fly. We went south to Lane, then turned around. There were a few parts of the trail that were icy and rough to run on, but overall it felt pretty good. We stopped for one traffic light, that was it for the whole run. The last three or four miles I was draggin, but I&#8217;m not too concerned with that. We did a last loop around the lake, and about halfway through Bridget picked it up. The very last .1 I pushed and caught up and we finished together, ~20 miles in 2:57. Dang! I&#8217;m content with that and will happily sink into a 2 week taper for Disney.
