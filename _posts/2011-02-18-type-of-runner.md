As I figure out my fitness plan for the next 3/6 months, I need to ask myself, what type of runner do I want to be? I&#8217;m currently at the lowest weight I can recall for years, and I set a PR last weekend just coming off injury. But I love the strength training I&#8217;m doing, looking and feeling strong. There&#8217;s a decision to make there, as there is a common perception that to be a fast distance runner, you need to be as light as possible. 

So I have a decision to make: do I want to stay where I am weight-wise in the hopes I&#8217;ll be a faster runner, or work on my strength and muscle, and bulk up a bit?

I thought about successful runners. Paula and Deena:

Deena may take in 5000 calories a day, but she&#8217;s sure not lifting!

Then I thought of male runners like Meb:

Yup &#8211; super thin and fast. They may be world class, but do really think they embody what I consider healthy and strong? They look like they blow away if they stop running those 5 minute miles! 

The fact is, I am NEVER going to be that fast. I&#8217;m just not. So how much do those few pounds really matter?

It was easy for me to think of a few runners that I admire and would love to emulate, who I think DO look strong. Chuck and Dean:

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/chuckengle-134x300.jpg" alt="" title="chuckengle" width="134" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1533" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/chuckengle.jpg) [<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/karnazes_dean-243x300.jpg" alt="" title="karnazes_dean" width="243" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1532" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/karnazes_dean.jpg)

Why do I admire these guys? They&#8217;re both really devoted extreme runners. Weekly marathons at least. They may not be winning every race (Ok, Chuck wins a lot of smaller races), but they don&#8217;t only do a race or two a year. They love to run, they&#8217;re strong and powerful and apparently can recover quickly? That&#8217;s the type of runner I want to be. I sorta think it&#8217;s the runner I was meant to be. Sure, being fast is nice but it&#8217;s not my true motivator. Hitting the roads (and trails) is, and I just think that having some extra strength and muscle (and weight) is maybe part of what makes that possible.

As I was reflecting on this matter, something occurred to me. I started dropping my weight late last year, so when I ran RnRAZ I was at my lowest weight in years. And, I got injured. My first marathon injury. Coincidence? Who knows. I actually asked Chuck about this today and he said that he thinks a bit of extra muscle may make you slower, but it does help with recovery. it seems to make sense. The more muscular your legs, the more you can tear em down and still have something there. 

So.. I don&#8217;t think I want to be the 110 lb runner. (I KNOW I don&#8217;t want to be the 110lb roller derby skater!). I want to be the strong, powerful athlete I know I can be. Weight (and muscle) gain, here I come!
