I ran the Pikes Peak marathon for the second time on my birthday weekend. It was a pretty busy weekend: Elyssa came in from New York, and I had a roller derby bout the night before the race. 

I had originally signed up to &#8216;double&#8217; &#8211; run the Ascent on Saturday and the marathon on Sunday &#8211; but I knew I was going to be playing a lot in the derby bout and I didn&#8217;t want to throw that off. It&#8217;s one thing to pile a lot onto yourself physically, but it&#8217;s another when you have a team counting on you. 

So while I didn&#8217;t run Saturday morning, Elyssa and I headed to the Springs to take the cog railway up to the top (I did the same with Helen last year &#8211; letting these flatlanders see what they&#8217;re getting into). I felt a little light-headed at the top, which was somewhat unusual.

As soon as we got back from Manitou (with a quick lunch stop at Subway) I headed off to the 1STBANK Center, which is where we bout (hold public roller derby events). I was pretty excited about playing on my birthday, and started the night off strong! My first time out to jam (the jammer is the point-scorer), I wracked up 25 points! That means I lapped the other skaters at least 5 times within 2 minutes. What a great birthday! Overall I went on to score over 80 points during the course of the game &#8211; which is more than the other team scored in total!



Part of the tradition of roller derby is the afterparty afterwards &#8211; all the skaters compete on the track, then kick back and socialize afterwards. Particularly since it was my birthday, I knew I couldn&#8217;t not go. I knew I had a long day ahead of me the next day, though, so I only had one drink (I had to &#8211; they had created a special cocktail for my birthday!). Eventually at around 1 I headed home &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t going to be too long til I had to get up again! 

Actual RACE report to come!
