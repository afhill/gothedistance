Yesterday there was a homework assignment posted on the [TBT Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/90dayTBT) (that I may or may not have posted myself):

> Ok TBTers &#8211; homework assignment! In the next few days, write a post about WHY you&#8217;re on the TBT. What do you want to achieve? What changes do you have to make for the program to help you succeed? Remember, just saying you&#8217;re on it isn&#8217;t enough! This is about TOTAL transformation!

So if I really think about why I went back on the program, here are the reasons:

  1. To remind myself to be a bit more stringent on the eats
  2. To have focus at the gym
  3. To get defined abs! I hate doing abs, but I really want to be able to see definition. The motivation is still lacking, but hopefully by my saying this here, I&#8217;ll be more accountable. 
      * This means I need to actually WORK my abs. I have a reasonably strong core, but the muscles don&#8217;t pop
      * I&#8217;m not too worried about bodyfat, but I can&#8217;t help but think getting it a bit lower may help. But it&#8217;s a balance, I don&#8217;t want to lose muscle elsewhere
  4. To continue to work on explosive power
  5. To work up to being able to bench [85lbs 30 times](http://www.arnoldsportsfestival.com/home/sports-and-events/pump-and-run.html)

Food  
&#8211; Ezekiel almond cereal with hemp seed and banana in non-fat milk  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; pb chickpea bar  
&#8211; 2 apples  
&#8211; 2 clif oatmeal raisin bars  
&#8211; veggie bologna, greens, dijon mustard on Ezekiel bread  
&#8211; vega sports protein  
&#8211; Greek yogurt with honey

Exercise  
&#8211; bench press with smith machine: 30xbar, 12x10lbs, 10x20lbs, 10x25lbs, 6x30lbs. This is gonna take awhile..  
&#8211; Mad Abs class  
&#8211; Power 30 class: 3x(20 bosu deck squats, 10 burpees, 10 Turkish get-ups, 20 over-unders, 20 frog jumps, 100 jumping jacks)  
&#8211; Kettlebell class. I honestly think kettlebell is the BEST workout. I was beat after the class! Did  
&#8212; 10 heavy 2hand swings (45-30lbs), superset 20 hand-to-hand swings (20-25)  
&#8212;5 goblet squats (45-30lbs), superset 10 high swings (20-25)  
&#8212; 5 presses (20) superset with 10 push presses (20)  
&#8212; 5 heavy rows (45-30) superset with 10 pullovers (20-25)  
&#8212; 5 floor presses (20-25-30) superset with 10 pushups  
My heavy weights went down but my lighter weights went up, I made it through 4 sets in a half hour. And felt completely trashed afterwards.
