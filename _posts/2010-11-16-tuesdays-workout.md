10min warmup,  
2x(6&#215;400 @ 1:39, 1:30 RI) &#8211; 2:30 RI  
10min cooldown

On the .1mile track, I equated 400 metres to 2.5 laps. Then I walked a lap and a half to start again. 

1: 1:39  
2: 1:40  
3: 2:21 for 3.5 laps (equates to 1:40)  
4: 2:20 for 3.5 laps (equates to 1:40)  
5: 1:40  
6: 1:39  
-longer rest-  
7: 1:39  
8: 1:41  
9: 1:40  
10: 1:38  
11: 1:41  
12: 1:41

Overall I ran 7 miles in 1:02:21. I can&#8217;t believe I did two extra laps early on! I was a bit off my target pace, but not enough that I&#8217;m concerned about it. A difference of a second can come from waiting to click a button. 

My knee felt great and gave me no problems at all. It wasn&#8217;t an easy workout though: I managed to get my heart rate all the way up to 186. Still, I pulled the workout off and I know I&#8217;m getting stronger every day!
