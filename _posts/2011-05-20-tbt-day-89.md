Ok body, for real. We have a bout tomorrow, time to feel better!

Tonight we had a team dinner, and they decided on pizza (regular and gluten-free). I didn&#8217;t want to be a pain, so I just kept quiet, but it&#8217;s sometimes tough to plan ahead. As I&#8217;m on th cusp of the official end of this program, I need to change my thoughts from &#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8221; to &#8220;I don&#8217;t&#8221;.. if I choose to avoid sugar or white flour, it&#8217;s not because the rules of a program dictate it, but because I have made that decision for my health. It&#8217;s actually empowering. I just swung by Tokyo Joe&#8217;s on my way to the gathering and was set!
