Work has been CRAZY the past few weeks. I have a huge looming deadline and other new projects keep showing up as well. This morning I was up working two hours early to try to make a dent in the work. Then we had an urgent crisis I had to respond to: as in, I had to recode something this evening for a client presentation in the morning. I still haven&#8217;t started some work that&#8217;s due Friday! Aaaaaah!

So, I knew I couldn&#8217;t devote 3+ hours to derby practice, I just couldn&#8217;t. But I got to a point tonight where I was so frustrated with the mountain of tasks, and decided I needed to run it off. 

I actually had speedwork on the plan: a 5 mile run at mid-tempo pace (7:13). So that pace sounds a little bit intimidating to me, especially since I still feel a bit sore from the weekend&#8217;s race (dangit, I owe a race report for that, too.. maybe next weekend). But I grabbed my new shoes and socks, and compression tights since apparently fall is here and it&#8217;s really cooled off. I headed to Sloan&#8217;s lake to try to avoid much elevation change.

Within a half mile, some guy pulled up next to me and commented on my shirt (I was wearing my &#8220;CIM &#8211; Marathon #28&#8221; shirt). We started chatting.. yes, even I was able to chat between breaths. He said we were going at a 6:40 pace! Yikes! Happily my watch started complaining and we dialed it back a bit. But it was good to have someone else to focus on, and drag me along. After a single loop, though, he left and I actually stopped and took a breather before continuing. When I started again, not talking, I was able to really cruise and my watch started complaining again. I dialed it back, and finished my run nice and strong. 

And just like that, less than 40 minutes later, I&#8217;d seen success. I&#8217;d pushed myself. I&#8217;d cleared my mind and my lungs. I&#8217;d found peace!

I think the stress and the running complemented each other: I ran faster b/c I was anxious, but then the speed helped me to clear out some of the junk floating in my mind. 

Distance: 5 miles  
Time: 35:54  
Splits: 6:57, 7:20, 7:10, 7:13, 7:19  
Average HR: 166

I&#8217;m pretty impressed with that heart rate &#8211; back in Jan 2010 I ran a 6 mile run at an 8:05 pace at a 170 average heart rate. Faster, with less effort!
