..so my Columbus registration form is in the mail.

I spoke with the executive director today, and he offered me complementary entry. It&#8217;s the week between Steamtown and Detroit, so I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s smart to run or not, but I figured that I might as well register, I can always not show up..
