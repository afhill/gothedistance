So this Sunday is the &#8220;Last Chance for Boston&#8221; half marathon. The 13.1 mile distance is no threat to me now, having raced 3 in the past year (as well as the marathon and 15 miler a few weeks back). I&#8217;ve set my sights on running a PR, or at least bettering my times from last year. My best time ever was my first half (May 2002), when I had aspirations only to break 2:00:00. My time was 1:42:38, which I was of course overjoyed with. Then I stopped running from July 2002 &#8211; December 2004, and my times this past year haven&#8217;t been close to that. (1:46.xx, 1:48.xx, 1:48.xx &#8211; in that order). Granted, I know I messed up my last half (Sept) because I started WAAAY too quickly, overestimating my abilities. I like training with &#8216;the group&#8217; but I tend to forget that I&#8217;m nowhere near their level when it comes to a competitive arena. I&#8217;m eager to see how things go this weekend, see if I can manage myself a bit better. I&#8217;m still learning race strategy in some ways.. although that refutes the fact that my best race was my first.. relying on whoever I&#8217;m running with to set the pace. I guess that will come through experience.
