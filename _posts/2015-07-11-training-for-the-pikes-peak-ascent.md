Although I&#8217;ve completed the Pikes Peak Ascent twice, it&#8217;s always been as part of doubling, doing the Ascent on Saturday and the Marathon on Sunday. This year I&#8217;m only doing the Ascent, so I&#8217;ll really get a chance to go all out and see what I can do. 

I&#8217;m really excited about it; I&#8217;ve been doing a ton of incline work at Orange Theory and I feel in really good hill-climbing shape. The other day we had a three minute hill climb on the treadmill where I started at 12% incline and ended at 18%, all around a 10 min mile or faster. Oof!

As for elevation, Sara and I went backpacking a few weekends ago up in the Flat Tops Wilderness area, all over 10K feet of elevation. Over three days we covered about 18 miles, all with 25+ pounds on our backs! So that&#8217;s got to count for something ðŸ™‚ Elyssa and Iain are coming to Colorado the week before the race and I&#8217;ve suggested we do [Grays and Torrey&#8217;s (14ers)](http://www.14ers.com/routemain.php?route=torr5&peak=Grays+Peak+and+Torreys+Peak) so that&#8217;ll help us get some good altitude in as well.

It always seems I get into a bit of a running slump around this time, but I feel less stressed about it because I dont have the whole Pikes Peak Marathon to be focusing on! 

How about goals, Andrea? You love goals.

So let&#8217;s see how I&#8217;ve done in the past with the Ascent:

  </tr>
</table>

So I have excuses for anything that&#8217;s been slower than 4 hours ðŸ™‚ The two Ascents I&#8217;ve done averaged around 3:40 but I wasn&#8217;t really focused on the Ascent and needed to hold something back for the next day. Given that, I feel like a 3:30 should be doable. 

Tomorrow Sara and I are going up to the mountain to run up near the top. I&#8217;ve warned her that those top few miles can take up to a half hour each, which I think is a bit beyond her comprehension for now. So, we&#8217;ll go try to get used to it before race day. I&#8217;m glad to be getting up there now, it seems like often I don&#8217;t get a chance to do it more than once or twice before the race. We still have a month to go, so hopefully we can get a couple trips in!
