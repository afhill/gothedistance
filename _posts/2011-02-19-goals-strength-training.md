As part of my plan to embark on a [90 day Total Body Transformation](http://90daytbt.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/so-you-want-a-total-body-transformation/), I decided I wanted to break down specifically my various goals related to strength training, running and nutrition. 

I&#8217;ve been going to Bootcamp three nights a week, PT twice a week and the gym 1-2 times a week, so I feel I have the time to commit 3-4 times a week. Following the advice of the gym trainer and Frida, I&#8217;m going to focus on specific body parts one day a week. 

Monday pm &#8211; legs and back  
Wednesday morning &#8211; chest and shoulders  
Friday am &#8211; arms  
(Sat afternoon &#8211; ?)

Abs 4 days a week, a combination of at home and at the gym

Right now I&#8217;m really focused on my legs so I&#8217;m trying to decide if I should be doing squats more than just that one day. Perhaps a variance of weighted squats on &#8216;legs day&#8217; and non-weight-bearing on other days. 

I don&#8217;t want to totally replace the explosive stuff I&#8217;ve been doing at boot camp (burpees, mountain climbers, etc) so I also need to find a way to work those in as well. 

I want to create a &#8216;travel plan&#8217; of different exercises I can do on the road. Often I don&#8217;t have time to do anything too intense, and/or may not have the means to pack exercise gear. 

Oh yeah&#8230; goals.  
Currently my left quad is 41cm, my right is 44. Those need to sync up. Beyond the fact I skate in a circle several hours per week, my left leg has always been weaker because of my accident. I simply need to get past it and work that leg harder so my overall stability and strength is improved. I&#8217;d like to see more definition on my legs. I still need to work on my glutes. I saw my before pics and was surprised at how muscular my back already is, I want to work on that. I want at least 4-pack abs. I want my triceps not to look like Mom arms. I guess those are the specifics, but overall I want to be buff!

My bodyfat is 16.2%. Arbitrarily, I guess it&#8217;d be cool to see it at 15%?
