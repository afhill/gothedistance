I was thrilled to get into a local physical therapist the day after my doc okayed me. I selected a place purely based on its proximity to my house. And so today 30 minutes before my appointment I loaded up a water bottle, my phone and wallet in a little backpack and self-propelled myself to [Physiotherapy Associates](http://www.physiocorp.com/facility/60537/CO/Boulder/Physiotherapy%20Associates%20-%20Boulder)!

I made good time, and my therapist was in workout clothes when she answered the door. She had me start on paperwork while she changed into &#8220;real clothes&#8221;. I laughed because this is Boulder. Those ARE real clothes!

We got to work and chatted away. We got along great, turns out she&#8217;s training for IM Canada! As she manipulated my kneecap I mentioned I was a runner, but figured that I may as well get into biking and swimming since it would be good for rehab anyway. She was super supportive and we chatted away about marathons and training and the IM Boulder course.

She had me do a few straight leg lifts, and hamstring holds. But we&#8217;d be so engrossed in our conversation I&#8217;d lose track of my reps. Whoops!

Then she even let me get on the stationary bike for a bit- not full revolutions but at least something. She said I should probably wait another few weeks to swim, and then hold a pull-buoy w my legs so I&#8217;m not kicking. She suggested that aqua jogging would be great as I got closer to being weight-bearing.

After some more exercises (I was there for over an hour!), abruptly she turned to me and said she thought I should go ahead and register for IM Boulder: that provided I was realistic in my goals, I&#8217;d physically be able to do it. I felt it was a pretty strong comment from someone who was seeing me in a pretty weak spot, and had herself completed a few marathons and IMs. [she did question if I&#8217;d be ready for New Yek, so she&#8217;s not overly Pollyanna-ish]

I iced my leg a bit before heading home. I actually used mapmyrun on the way home and it came to .7 miles. I was just happy to be out there getting some exercise in!

I feel really fortunate I chose Erica at Physiotherapy Associates: I honestly chose it purely due to location and right before I met her I wondered if I should have done more research. But I feel really confident in her and expect it&#8217;ll all go great!
