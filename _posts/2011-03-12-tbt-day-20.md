Cheat day, oh yeah!! I did it up well today!

#### Food:

  * 7:30 protein pancakes. Then I remembered what day it was..
  * 8:00 chocolate! ðŸ™‚
  * 11:00 orange, pumpkin seeds
  * 11:45 dirty nonfat chai with sugar-free vanilla syrup, sample of marble loaf
  * 1:45 cheese and crackers
  * 2:30 Liks ice cream &#8211; peanut butter and jelly, lemon chip
  * 4:00 more Liks ice cream &#8211; black gold
  * 8:00 veggie pizza, 1/2 a bud light
  * 10:30 orange

So if all these seeds are a good source of protein (hemp, chia, pumpkin), why aren&#8217;t birds more buff?? I asked a friend this this afternoon and after she stopped laughing, she said that she actually knows someone who doesn&#8217;t like free range poultry b/c the birds are more muscular from being able to roam..

#### Exercise

  * 10mile bike ride
  * Hamstrings: [Stiff-legged Barbell deadlift](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/stiff-legged-barbell-deadlift): 50lbs 3&#215;15. 50lbs is the heaviest EZ bar they have in the women&#8217;s rack room.. I&#8217;ll up the weight next time. 
  * Back hyperextensions: 25lbs 2&#215;10
  * Middle back: Bent over Row (machine) 90lbs 3&#215;5
  * Lats: [Close grip lat pulldown](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/close-grip-front-lat-pulldown) level 6-15 15 13

I got to the gym less than a half hour til closing and tried to get in as much as I could, then came back to my apartment complex to finish up. I didn&#8217;t mention it yesterday, but I felt different at yoga. Overall much more aware of my body and its strength. I could tell I&#8217;ve been working on my core/glutes. I felt quite centered and powerful.

And my big excitement for the morning, I found out that Bodybuilding.com has an iPhone app! I&#8217;ve been accessing their site on my phone to look up exercises while at the gym, and this just made it sooo much easier! 

It was nice to have a good cheat day where I let myself indulge. Though I really didn&#8217;t need that much ice cream, and I know if I weren&#8217;t on the TBT, I wouldn&#8217;t have had seconds! But it was a nice splurge.
