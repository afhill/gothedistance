It&#8217;s the end of the month, so I was looking at my stats for the year so far. I&#8217;ve logged 611 miles in 2005. I&#8217;ve run between 15 &#8211; 21 days per month (15 in April since I took time off after Boston) and my average distance per run has steadily increased.

Jan: 18 days &#8211; avg 4.07  
Feb: 19 days &#8211; avg. 4.13  
Mar: 21 days &#8211; avg. 4.87  
Apr: 15 days &#8211; avg 5.77 (nearly a week off after boston)  
May: 20 days &#8211; avg. 6.29 

Today was supposed to be my &#8216;marathon dress rehearsal&#8217; &#8211; one mile warm-up, then 4 at MP, then a cool down. I thought a 7.7 mph pace on the treadmill was about 8:08, but it turns out it was sub-8. So my 4 miles were closer to half-marathon pace than full. But it felt ok, so that&#8217;s a good thing!
