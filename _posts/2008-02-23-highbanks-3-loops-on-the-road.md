Today I met the gang out at highbanks. As always, the poor weather meant we had a good crowd: Andy, Mike, Bridget, Meredith and Dave, Niels and Aisha, Doug B and Steve. We opted for the roads rather than the trails, and still Bridget, Dave and Mike wore yak traks. 

The road is much &#8220;less fun&#8221; than the trails to run. It&#8217;s a 3.75 mile loop with a steady but subtle downward slope at the start. Then you need to trudge up this seemingly endless hill at around the 1.5 mile point. We all strongly dislike the hill.

I was supposed to do 16 miles today, but I was ok with stopping after 3 loops (11.22mi, according to my watch). I&#8217;ve been feeling a bit under the weather this week, and actually ended up with a little coughing fit at the end of the last hill. It cleared up though and I felt decent as I finished up.  
I like this picture from my garmin training center, which makes me feel vindicated in thinking that hill goes on forever (it really looks like it does!) The dramatic drops in my heart rate are at the start/end of the loop when we all stop our watches and regroup before starting up again.  
A few of us ended up at Panera afterwards, as per winter run tradition. I love that I&#8217;ve been running with this same group of people for years. Andy and Meredith were talking about the half Ironman they did three years ago, and it just shocks me, I can&#8217;t believe it was that long ago! Running with &#8216;the gang&#8217; is just so much a part of who I am, I&#8217;m so thankful for my great (albeit, perhaps a little running-crazed) friends!
