So I decided to work on my speed. Today I hit the gym to try to ease my way up to that 7:30 min mile pace.

1.5 miles 9:30 pace  
.25 mile 9:00  
.25 mile 8:30  
.25 mile 8:00  
.25 mile 7:30

.5 mile 9:00  
.25 mile 8:30  
.25 mile 8:00  
.5 mile 7:30

.5 mile 9:00  
.25 mile 8:00  
.75 mile 7:30

the plan was to do another half mile at a 9 min pace, then do a mile at 7:30, and then a cooldown mile, but I had to go to the restroom. I jumped off the treadmill, headed to the locker room. Came back to the treadmill and started it up again at the 9 min pace. I&#8217;d barely started when _I threw up a little in my mouth!_ yuck yuck yuck! Now, this was around 8:15am and I&#8217;d had breakfast at 6, so that shouldn&#8217;t have been an issue. It was just nastiness and I decided right then and there to stop running. Too bad, too, b/c I was feeling pretty good!
