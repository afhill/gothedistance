Today was a MUCH better day!

Woke up early to get in my last run before the race. On the schedule I had 10 min warmup, 6x(400m @ 1:30, 400m RI), 10 min cooldown. I headed to the ole rec center. The run went great, with my intervals coming in at 1:31, 1:28, 1:28, 1:27, 1:28, 1:26. Nice! I finished feeling strong and confident. 

Also, 75 pushups (over the course of the day)

Now that the running is done, the nutrition is the last piece before the race. I worked on hydration today:

Food  
&#8211; vega sports optimizer pre-run  
&#8211; vega sports protein post-run  
&#8211; tofu scramble and hashbrowns  
&#8211; greek yogurt  
&#8211; coconut water  
&#8211; half an EAS protein drink  
&#8211; seaweed snacks  
&#8211; green goodness juice  
&#8211; baked squash with olive oil, pinenuts and garlic  
&#8211; wilted spinach  
&#8211; propel zero. I mistook this for Vitamin Water Zero. This had sucralose üôÅ  
&#8211; banana

I watched the Special Features Hood to Coast DVD and got pretty emotional. I love my sport.
