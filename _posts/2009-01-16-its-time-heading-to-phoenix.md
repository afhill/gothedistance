I can&#8217;t believe in a few hours I&#8217;ll be in Phoenix! I&#8217;ve had my sights set on this weekend for so long, it&#8217;s scary to think that it&#8217;s time to make it count. 

Sometimes I wonder if I run so many races so that I don&#8217;t have to worry so much about them. My marathon PRs (Steamtown 05, Chicago 06) both took place during a streak of marathons. Maybe that doesn&#8217;t really mean anything, but it took a bit of pressure off the months of training leading up to a single event.

<!--more-->My best friend at work has been giving me grief lately, every time someone coughs or sneezes by me, I express concern at getting sick. I just feel like everything has to fall into place for things to go the way I want.

I know I shouldn&#8217;t be so concerned: I&#8217;ve worked hard, and even when I ran Steamtown in &#8217;07, I was on pace for a 3:25 through mile 18, despite the fact it was a ridiculously hot day. I know my training plan was a good one, and I know I feel stronger than ever before. 

I&#8217;ve been really busy at work this week, so I haven&#8217;t had much time to really focus on what&#8217;s going to transpire (that I will complete a marathon in less than 3:22:59 to earn guaranteed entry into the New York City Marathon). But I&#8217;ve turned off my work email on my phone and still haven&#8217;t decided if my computer is even coming with me to Phoenix. I&#8217;ve done the physical preparation, now I just need to get my head in the game, and get this done..
