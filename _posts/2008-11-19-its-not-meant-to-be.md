This morning I tried to fit in my 90min progression run: 3 sections of 30 minutes each, getting progressively more difficult. I hit the treadmill so that I wouldn&#8217;t even have to worry maintaining a pace.

The first 30 minutes was fine; I ran 3.37miles at an overall 8:54 pace.  
I started my second 30 minutes and only got in about 10 minutes before my right knee started hurting. After a few more steps, I decided that I was better off stopping than pushing through and really setting myself back. So in this second section I ran 1.32miles in 10:59 at an overall 8:19 pace.

I did some stretching and some weights just to add to my workout, but I&#8217;m calling it a day. Tomorrow I had an option of an off day or an easy day (after what was supposed to be a speed workout today). We&#8217;ll see what I decide to do. When it comes down to it, today wasn&#8217;t really a hard workout, so I&#8217;m not sure how safe to play it. We&#8217;ll see..
