Had a good month, logging 189.26 miles. I took 6 days off, so that&#8217;s an average of 7.57 miles per run. I spent 26:57 running &#8211; that&#8217;s almost 27 HOURS of running, wowza!  
Overall I feel really strong. Even during the week of my highest mileage (57), my average pace was above 8:40 on every run.

As for 2008, I finished up the year having run 1705 miles. I ran 322 days out of the year (my new years resolution to run every day except for the day after marathons held until August).  
2008 was the year I BQed at Boston, I ran my 20th marathon and I shaved 1:45 off my 50K PR. I moved to Colorado, and am hoping to see an improvement in my running because of it!
