Hard to believe it&#8217;s only 4 weeks to Vegas! I mailed in my proof of completing a marathon under 4 ours to get into a preferred corral, although sub-4 still seems like it could include a TON of folks!

I haven&#8217;t run at all since Sunday, but I suppose I should get back into it&#8211; 

Long runs:  
Nov 3: 7-10?  
Nov 10: 10-15?  
Nov 17: 17-20?  
Nov 24 (thanksgiving weekend): 5-10?

Or is 20 a good idea two weeks in advance? not sure if I should do 20 on Nov 10th to give me some more recovery time.. hm&#8230;
