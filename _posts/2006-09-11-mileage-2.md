I was lamenting on my run with Mike and Meredith the other day that I hadn&#8217;t been keeping up with my mileage. However, since I started back on my training schedule, I have kept track, so without further adieu:

August 06: 139.75

Definitely down from the 183.6 from last year, but I keep telling myself that this year&#8217;s marathon is 2 weeks later, so my high mileage week was actually this past week (cleared 50). Also, I definitely did harder training last year, but I&#8217;d like to think some of the benefits are still lingering (ha, keep telling myself, I may believe it!)
