Another crazy snowfall here in the Mile High City &#8211; generally I&#8217;d stay at home but I had a meeting in the office at 1pm. The roads actually weren&#8217;t bad driving in but I still decided I deserved a treat for it &#8211; Iced Bhakti Chai/Coffee blend. Love the ginger burn!

Food  
&#8211; quinoa, hemp milk, hemp seed, chia seed, cinnamon  
&#8211; iced Bhakti Chai/coffee blend  
&#8211; [SaviSeeds](http://saviseed.com/about-saviseed/what-is-saviseed) (which taste like seeds, not like nuts as their marketing claims)  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; seaweed salad  
&#8211; miso soup (I thought &#8220;this would be great for an ultra&#8221;. What&#8217;s wrong with me???)  
&#8211; sesame tofu with brown rice  
&#8211; apple  
&#8211; black beans, brown rice, green chile sauce (which I noticed later has unbleached flour in it üôÅ ) guacamole, blue corn chips  
&#8211; orange gatorade that I tried to pretend was really cheap margarita. I was unconvinced

Exercise  
I wanted to go run with the [Highland Tap and Burger Run club](http://www.facebook.com/groups/HTBrunclub/), but I coughed all last night after yesterday&#8217;s run and I figured another jaunt in the cold wouldn&#8217;t help me recover. So, I hit the gym. Not terribly intense, but it was something.  
&#8211; bench press &#8211; 30x10lbs, 10x50lbs, 3x60lbs  
&#8211; atomic pushups  
&#8211; TRX rows  
&#8211; shoulders  
&#8211; assisted pullups
