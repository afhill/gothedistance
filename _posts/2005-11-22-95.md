So I joined Cal Fit today and promptly dropped in on their total body conditioning class. But Katie is no longer the instructor, and it wasn&#8217;t near as good a class as they used to be. Still, it felt good to be doing some general strength training, that general fatigue from doing weights that feels so darned good! I guess part of me is glad Katie isn&#8217;t doing her Tuesday classes, since I&#8217;ll have school Tuesdays and I&#8217;ll be sorry to miss them ðŸ™‚ But Michelle is still doing the Sunday TBC class, or there is a Boot CAmp at the Henderson location on Sundays, so I may give them a try. I may have to also try out spinning at the downtown location at 6am Tues and Thurs&#8230;
