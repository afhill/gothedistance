I&#8217;ll give myself props for one thing: when I fall down, I get up with more vengeance than ever. After the marathon snafu on Sunday, I&#8217;m even more dedicated to get healthy and in shape!

I&#8217;ve been watching the gals over at [http://90daytbt.wordpress.com](http://90daytbt.wordpress.com/) closely, checking out their workouts and food. While I&#8217;m not quite sure I&#8217;m totally dedicated to super-healthy eating, I&#8217;m going to give it a try. Last night I did some reading on the [Eat Clean&reg; Diet](http://www.eatcleandiet.com/) and it definitely seems to make some sense. 

I&#8217;m also going to do my best to track what I&#8217;m doing, in part to hold myself accountable. 

The other week the chiro gave me some exercises to do with free weights to help my shoulder, so I went to the gym at my apartment. I did some shoulder and arm exercises, focusing on lighter weights with more reps. I tend to carry a lot of tension in my shoulders and I think I do more harm than good with heavy weights. I started to do abs as well but wasn&#8217;t feeling it.  
My hips don&#8217;t hurt today, but they&#8217;re definitely sensitive. My hamstrings are really tight, and also have that &#8220;snapping&#8221; sensation. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve dealt with for awhile but after this weekend I&#8217;m realizing that I really do need to figure things out. I did some research and see that the IT Band can actually be a cause of <a href=http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/otherhip/a/snappinghip.htm>snapping hip</a>, so I&#8217;m a bit concerned about that. For those not in the know, I had IT Band problems when I started running, which caused me to miss my first marathon back in &#8217;02. I actually quit running altogether for about a year as a result. 

The good news is that I&#8217;m going to see a sports doctor on Thursday who specializes in hips, so hopefully I can get this all worked out.
