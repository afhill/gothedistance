Well I&#8217;m getting excited about Columbus. I&#8217;m going to meet up with some forumites at the Expo tomorrow at 3, and jog on down to the start with my rez manager on Sunday. 

I am going to concentrate on taking it easy, b/c I really want to be able to do Detroit. So my goal is simply not to set a new &#8216;pw&#8217;. So I have to run 3:57:42 or better. Then depending on how I feel, make the decision on Monday for Detroit. If I do it, I&#8217;m SO going to make a shirt that says &#8220;where am I? Steamtown 10/09 Columbus 10/16 Detroit 10/23&#8221;. I don&#8217;t want to make it before Columbus and jinx myself, although it would have been neat to wear for all the races.

I can&#8217;t believe how good I feel. Absolutely no soreness at all, although I haven&#8217;t actually run since Sunday. I did 45 min on the bike yesterday, and then some weights. It&#8217;s been so long since I did any strength training, it felt great! I&#8217;m meeting Cheryl for an easy 5 and 5, so we&#8217;ll see how that goes!
