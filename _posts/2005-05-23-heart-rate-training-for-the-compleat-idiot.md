Today was my first day at &#8216;heart rate training&#8217;. I&#8217;ve been reading &#8220;heart rate training for the compleate idiot&#8221; so today I set out on an &#8216;easy run&#8217; to try this stuff out. The book states that there are two &#8216;magic numbers&#8217;, your recovery ceiling (basically 70% of your max), and your threshold floor (close to 85% of your max).  
The formula I used (Which they state right off is likely inaccurate) was  
**205 &#8211; 14** (half my age) **+ 5** (for being female). **196** is therefore my estimated max.  
My estimated max **&#8211; 53** (my resting heart rate, although this may not be accurate itself) gives me my range of **143**. To get my recovery ceiling, I take that ***.7** and **+53** (to get my resting heart rate back in) to get **153**.

So I set out around my apartment complex with my FitSense set to beep when I surpassed this Recovery ceiling of 153. Let me tell you, it was pretty easy to hit it! Luckily however I was able to get my heart rate back down quite easily, generally by stopping for one step, or sometimes just jogging slower. The little incline was the toughest, however, and I often had to walk.

What&#8217;s really interesting is the graph of my heart rate versus speed. It will be interesting to see how things progress &#8211; right now the two lines are VERY close, I can only expect the deviation with them will open up as I&#8217;m able to go faster with a lower heart rate?
