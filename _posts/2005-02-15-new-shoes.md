today was GORGEOUS! So much so that I skipped out on my plan to hit the gym and went to target and bought some cheap running clothes so I could run outside instead. Tried out the new shoes I bought.. which may not have been a good thing. Granted, my knee is bruised (I think from Sunday), but I ended up having to walk the last .2 of the 6 miles since my knee was hurting so bad. When I picked out the shoes (Sauconys of course, but a different style than I&#8217;m used to), I was excited b/c they seemed to have more arch support than I&#8217;m used to. Now I&#8217;m wondering if that&#8217;s a good thing, if perhaps I picked out some for ppl who pronate (I don&#8217;t). Before worrying too much about the shoes, however, I should also pay attention to the fact that my carb intake lately has been about zilch, although I&#8217;ve been craving protein like it&#8217;s my job (I even had a hamburger yesterday at Fuddruckers &#8211; the first in a year and a half!). So that may have somehow contributed to my low energy, and resulted in lazy running or somethin. Who knows. I&#8217;m off to finish off my Fazoli&#8217;s lasagna, and hopefully these danged shoes will perform better tomorrow &#8212; I was planning on wearing them Sunday&#8211;
