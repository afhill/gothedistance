I need to go back and re-read my posts from 49 weeks ago. You know, when I said &#8220;no more multiple marathons&#8221;&#8230;

although it&#8217;s too late now b/c I just registered for Columbus!

I knew I was done for when we were standing around this morning in the dark, rain pouring down, getting up the motivation to start our run. Someone asked Doug if he was running Columbus or Chicago. He looked at me and started snickering. I answered for him, &#8220;It may not be a question of OR&#8221;. Then people caught on, &#8220;you mean you&#8217;re doing both? Andrea, you too?&#8221; And then I found myself explaining how it was do-able, running easy and then resting much of the week. So of course I had to go ahead and register!
