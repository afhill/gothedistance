My bite sandals arrived today.. too bad we&#8217;re expecting 1 &#8211; 2 inches of snow by 7pm!! 🙁

The UPS delivery woman commented on the fact I had shoes and socks arriving: she must think I never leave the apartment to shop! But sadly enough, when you work on the computer and you do your homework on the computer, it&#8217;s just so darned easy to shop on here as well (not to mention, why pass up smartwool socks at 50% off????)
