I&#8217;ve always felt that my talent for running was good endurance: I can not run for months, and go out and hammer away for quite awhile. However, I&#8217;ve never been particularly good at short distances. More of a tortoise than a hare, I guess..

I run mostly marathons, although I did one ultra, and I keep eying other long distance events. I think to some extent it&#8217;s about the experience; I honestly love to run, and I&#8217;d rather be on the road for several hours at a comfortable pace than 30 minutes of heart-pounding agony. I&#8217;ve also been fortunate enough to recover quickly, enabling me to run {3 marathons in 6 weeks, 3 marathons in 3 weeks}.

This year I decided to try something different, and decided to commit to running at least a mile every day. They say it takes 3 weeks to develop a habit; well it&#8217;s been over two months and it is definitely a part of my life now!  
Probably the most interesting part is that whereas in January I had a few &#8220;1 mile just to get it in&#8221; days, I don&#8217;t anymore. I figure I can at least go out for a couple miles, even in the worst of weather. And it feels good! Looking at my [logyourrun](http://www.logyourrun.com) stats, my speed isn&#8217;t suffering for it, either!

Granted, I did race last Sunday (did I mention that? I ran the Arnold 5K &#8211; 21:59, which I&#8217;m happy with), and then did a speed workout on Tuesday. But overall, I feel really good. When Meredith and I were out on Wednesday, I hit a low point where I felt a bit tired, but I got over it. I don&#8217;t really have any aches or pains or soreness, which I&#8217;m extremely happy about. I should hit 50 miles this week, and am averaging well over 30 per week so far this year. I wasn&#8217;t sure how I&#8217;d feel with no days off, but I&#8217;m actually finding I have more energy, more strength. I&#8217;ve recently started doing ab work again, and riding at least a bit a couple days a week. Today I went out during our &#8220;blizzard warning&#8221; and hammered out 6 miles, and felt really good the whole time. I think my body just likes running.. a LOT. Be that at a time, or on cumulative days ðŸ™‚
