Forget belonging to a gym to work out in &#8211; this club is for recovering AFTER those workouts!

I joke that this is something you&#8217;d only see in Boulder, but I&#8217;m actually tickled to live so close to a community that can support a club like this. For a monthly fee, [AllSports Recovery](http://allsportsrecovery.com/) offers daily access to all sorts of foam rollers and sticks, an inversion table, lasers/TENS systems, an ice bath tub, and these crazy compression boots. There are also massage interns available for 15 minute massages (you get one per day included in your membership.)

They also have a selection of discounted services as well: ultrasound, gralston, k-taping, chiropractic. 

There was actually a write-up in 5280 magazine the other day (&#8220;[Take it Easy](http://www.5280.com/magazine/2012/01/take-it-easy)&#8220;) which hinted that a Denver location may be in the works, so perhaps I&#8217;ll have to change my sentiment to &#8220;only in Colorado&#8221;.

The idea behind the club is that most athletes can&#8217;t afford these types of tools at home to aid in recovery. On a Sunday afternoon just while I was there, there were a good half-dozen athletes that wandered in to take advantage of the various services. Actually when I walked in, half of the compression boot chairs were being occupied by people I knew: my coach Darren, his wife Colleen, and Lydia. 

I gave the boots a try &#8211; sat down in front of the Ravens-Patriots game on the big screen (which I didn&#8217;t care about, but the guys seemed to) for a half hour. The compression pressure was strong. Not to the point of discomfort, but I definitely felt the &#8220;metabolic wastes being flushed&#8221; (that&#8217;s what the girl who showed me around said they did). Then I tried the inversion table. The inversion table is right next to the ice bath, and some guy in the ice bath explained that I could actually go all the way back, lock the table out and hang suspended by my feet (not touching the table at all), like a bat. It actually felt great and made me think fondly of my gymnastics days, some 25 years ago. 

After the table, the blood rush to my head (and the fact I suspected I was now 5&#8217;4&#8243; rather than 5&#8217;3&#8243;) emboldened me and I decided to try the cold laser with TENS. My achilles has been a little tight so I lathered on some conductor fluid (something like that..) and gave it a try. The TENS sent little sensations all through my heel, which was kinda amazing.

Yikes! It was harder than my foam roller and the bumps really got deep. 

Eventually I got tired of playing, and decided to head home. As I walked out of the club, I felt like my muscles had been worked/flushed out. I didn&#8217;t bother waiting for a massage, but Lydia was getting some work done. I&#8217;m actually really interested in the [Gralston technique](http://www.grastontechnique.com/), which seems painful but great at loosening up scar tissue, etc. Last year I had the hip doctor as well as a massage therapist tell me that it&#8217;s likely my IT band on the left is a bit tight due to scar tissue from my car accident. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if some of this treatment (or perhaps even the less intense laser) can help. It&#8217;s not actively hindering my performance, but every bit helps, right?

Going into the club, I was a bit skeptical: did I really need all this stuff? I wasn&#8217;t injured, I felt fine. But once in those boots and feeling what it felt like to truly get worked over, I can see the benefits to it. I asked Lydia how frequently she went: she said the week leading up the marathon, she went every day. Wow! I like the idea of being able to be proactive in looking after yourself rather than waiting for serious injury. Right now I pay $49/month for a Massage Envy membership, which gives me one massage a month. At AllSports, I could get one several times a week (granted, only 15 minutes, not the full hour I get at ME). But the other services they provide, while not necessary, seem to offer more well-rounded self-care than just a single massage. 

I sure hope they open that Denver location soon! Although&#8230; right now I train in Boulder twice a week, and those are most most intense workouts. They&#8217;re likely the ones that would be best to follow up with a treatment&#8230; Would I really go more frequently than that anyway?

P.S. They&#8217;ve also been featured in WIRED Magazine: &#8220;[Recovery Club: Pro-Level Training Tools for Weekend Warriors](http://www.wired.com/playbook/2011/09/pro-level-training-for-weekend-warriors/#more-7592) How cool is that?
