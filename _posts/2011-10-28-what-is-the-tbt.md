TBT stands for &#8220;Total Body Transformation&#8221;. A few skaters from the local [Rocky Mountain Rollergirls](http://www.rockymountainrollergirls.com) roller derby league came up with a 90 day program that involves [eating clean](http://www.eatcleandiet.com) 6 days a week and working out 5 days a week. 

I did my first round of the program in early 2011 and it revolutionized my relationship with food and my body. I became a lacto-ovo vegetarian and pretty well gave up coffee at the same time. After the 90 days were over, I kept most of my same habits. I started another round of the program on Oct 1, 2011. 

I&#8217;ve seen incredible gains in my energy and strength since cleaning up my diet. I don&#8217;t have the same cravings I once did (I was a bit of a sugar fiend) and I honestly don&#8217;t want to live a life that relies on stimulants to get through the day.
