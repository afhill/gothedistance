Now I&#8217;m aching to get back into it, but I&#8217;m not there yet. I started doing short runs on the treadmill in December, just a mile or two alternating walking and running. It was definitely rehabilitiation, not what I&#8217;d consider running. 

Thankfully, over the past month or so things have fallen into place and I;m feeling more like myself. Since I had to learn to run anew, I decided to take this time to learn how to become more of a forefoot striker, and after a really awkward &#8220;are you on your toes?&#8221; stage, this new gait has started to feel natural.

Part of my motivation is due to the fact I applied for and was selected to be part of the Runners Roost Race team! I&#8217;ve known several members of the team for years but this is the first time I applied and I&#8217;m thankful they selected me. It put a little bit of pressure on me, but that&#8217;s the best way to nudge me into action. 

Many of the Roost runners also participate in a local training group, Runners Edge of the Rockies. I decided that was also a great way to hold myself accountable and get back into my oold routine. The group (probably 100-strong) meets at different locations every Saturday and runs up to 20 miles. This past Saturday was the Spring session kickoff. 

I&#8217;ve been running about 9:45 on my runs, so I lined up with the 4hr pace group, intending to do 6-8 miles. I ended up chatting with Brian, who moved here from Columbus OH last year! We chatted about Ohio, and of course marathons. We steadily pulled away from the 4 hr pace group, who were doing about an 11 min pace (huh???) and caught up with the 3:50 runners at the 5 mile turnaround. Before I knew it, it was the 8 mile turnaround and I was debating what to do. Brian and two others in the group said they were going to go up one more mile. I told myself I could do one more.. without considering that one more out meant 10 miles total&#8230;  
Overall I felt pretty good. The last 3 miles or so I was starting to feel tired (most notably my left hip flexor, not my knee at all!), especially on the slight uphills. I dropped behind my new friends and walked some, although I was then able to catch up with the couple (Deirdre and her husband) before the end. Overall I did about 9.5 miles at a 9:50 pace.

It wasnt lost on my that on 1/20/13 I ran 13.1 miles at a 6:50 pace and on 1/18/14 I ran 9.5 at a 9:50 pace. But ya know what? It still felt amazing to be back out there again. Even if my knees and hips may argue, I am in my heart and soul a distance runner.
