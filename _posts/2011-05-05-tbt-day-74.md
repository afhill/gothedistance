I actually didn&#8217;t have anything going on right after work, so decided to work out then. That left me to playing in the kitchen this morning: I made powerballs and a variation of the [Thrive mango coconut energy bar](http://myvega.com/blog/2008/mango-coconut-energy-bars) (with no coconut, almonds instead of macadamia nuts, and added chia seeds). And I made balls instead of bars. </li> 

#### Food: cheat day!

  * smoothie: egg whites, nonfat milk, hemp protein powder, wheat germ, chia seeds, apple, kiwi, orange
  * powerball
  * quinoa, strawberries, cinnamon in nonfat milk
  * one square sea salt chocolate, one piece coconut curry chocolate
  * kung pao tofu, black bean quinoa salad
  * almond nut-thins, hemp hummus
  * small DQ turtle pecan blizzard. I think it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve ever ordered a small blizzard! Not as great as I was expecting
  * apple
  * iced green tea unsweetened lemonade
  * vega sport performance optimizer pre-workout
  * vega sport protein post-workout
  * mango energy ball
  * clean cinco de mayo! [guacamole](http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=301283), [tomatillo salsa verde](http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/tomatillo_salsa_verde/) (I left out the sugar), regular salsa, pita chips and almond cheese &#8220;nachos&#8221;
  * margarita

And it&#8217;s official, I can feel it. Sugar like that blizzard add to my cravings. I wanted coffee afterwards.
