46 days after undergoing mosaicplasty knee surgery, I took my first steps on my own today! 

Last Tuesday the doctor told me I could start weight-bearing, and steadily move onto using one crutch and then walking unassisted. I took a few days to just get used to putting weight on my leg. It was strange at first but it didn&#8217;t feel too bad. I know the time I&#8217;ve spent on the bike has kept my leg muscles from atrophying too much. 

I also got a pool pass three days ago, so for the past three days I&#8217;ve gone to the rec center and practiced pool walking. They have a lazy river that&#8217;s about 4ft deep so I&#8217;ve practiced just walking with the water swirling around me &#8211; some of the forces seemed tough! But it&#8217;s greatly increased my confidence. I did a lot of pool therapy when I broke my left knee and femur years ago. 

Yesterday I did some walking with one crutch, but I don&#8217;t actually like it. I feel as though it causes me to limp more as my support is off-center. I recall this from last time as well &#8211; I went from two crutches for three months to only a few days with a single crutch. When I leave the house I bring both but I&#8217;ve been doing a little bit of wandering around the house without crutches. 

I see rehabilitation like I see language learning: Sure, you can rush through and more or less achieve the goal you have (walk with no crutches, communicate with someone). There may be errors but you accomplished the base objective. But, that&#8217;s not how I do things. In language learning as well as in rehab, I&#8217;d rather take the time and get it right. It&#8217;s ok with me if it takes me five minutes to walk around rather than two if I&#8217;m not learning bad habits. 

It&#8217;s still a bit surreal, actually. To think that a week ago I dangled my right foot wherever I went, and now I&#8217;m able to stand comfortably and don&#8217;t even think about walking around to do things. I&#8217;m SO excited! 

I anticipate it&#8217;ll be tough to have to be patient with running and riding outside, but hopefully this pool pass will keep me occupied for the time being. In the meantime, it feels like that chapter of my life is sorta closed and I&#8217;m truly on the right side of it all!
