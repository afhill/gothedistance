I&#8217;m actually considering changing the name of my blog.. 

I really enjoyed the Pikes Peak race series: the Ascent, Marathon and Road Ascent. It&#8217;s crazy to think that in eight days I raced over 51 miles and climbed over nineteen THOUSAND feet (and descended perhaps eight thousand?) 

At the end of the Road Ascent, the announcer read out my name, and then said &#8220;well that&#8217;s an appropriate surname, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; I suppose it is.. 

A few years ago, one of my running buddies wrote a haiku for me as I prepared to run Pikes Peak for the first time:

> Thin air, rocky trails  
> Up and down the noble peak  
> Hill conquers mountain

Today I drove down to Colorado Springs to pick up my age group award from the Road Ascent: I netted some good swag in the past few weeks!

I really adored these races: it&#8217;s bad that I can&#8217;t wait til next year! While I was in the Springs I also picked up an Incline club tank top I&#8217;ll proudly sport. This is on the back:

I woke up this morning raring to run, but I held off because I&#8217;m racing tomorrow and I want to honestly try to follow this danged training plan (3 days a week!). Hopefully it&#8217;ll pay off!
