Monday: a fast 5 miles at a 7:17 pace with Stu from Twitter. It was chilly and windy and my stomach cramped up after 3 of our targeted 6 strides. I ended up quitting early üôÅ

Tuesday: [Crossfit in the am](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/04/crossfit-wod-double-ds/): deadlifts and jumping rope. Then in the evening I had a great workout with the RRBs (1K repeats), 8.4 miles in 1:12.

Wednesday: 5 miles at an 8:11 pace in the morning. Then met the Runners Roost Run Club in the evening. Felt like a very nice and relaxed run, but it turned out to be still at an 8:35 pace (3.59 miles)

Thursday: [Crossfit &#8220;Hero&#8221; workout in the am](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/04/crossfit-wod-hero-del/). The hero workouts are supposedly the toughest. Then in the afternoon I had planned to run 8-10 but only squeaked out 6.15 at an 8:34 pace. The pace is deceiving, I wasn&#8217;t enjoying this run very much. I can only assume it was in part due to the tough workout in the morning (which included 4x400m carrying a medicine ball!). My legs were just feeling not &#8220;as-fresh&#8221; as I&#8217;d like them to, so I actually decided to take Friday as a rest day. 

Friday: uh huh.. it was WAY too gorgeous out in the morning not to enjoy it! Dashed off an easy 3 at an 8:46 pace.

Saturday: we had a great workout planned with the RRBs, a good chunk of it at half marathon pace. When I reviewed my pace afterwards, I was exactly right on! (As in, my projected finish time with that pace would be 1:30:01 &#8211; can&#8217;t get any closer than that!) In all, did the 9 miles in a 7:59 pace. 

Sunday: I&#8217;d been thinking I may take Sunday off as well, as my folks were in town, but I woke up early so I decided to get a few miles in. (Also &#8211; yes, I wanted to get closer to 45mpw). My watch was dead as I headed out so I ran a very simple route so I could gmap it when I got home. I wanted to do perhaps 4.25 and it ended up being 4.03. Ugh!! I resisted the urge to go run around the block a few times, but it was hard&#8230; then later that afternoon Mom and I hiked [the Incline](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/05/i-did-the-incline/ "I did the Incline!") in Colorado Springs, then came down the 2.5 miles Barr Trail. 

Total: 44.92 miles running, ~3 miles hiking (ahhhh!)

I wasn&#8217;t feeling super on Thursday, so I was ok with lowering my mileage a bit. My race is next Sunday so I should be tapering and feeling good and strong, not worrying about racking up miles for the sake of miles. The Incline is always a good workout, in fact my calves were feeling it the next day! 

With my folks in town, I ate a lot of junk I shouldn&#8217;t. And I could definitely tell. I&#8217;ve already become accustomed to not having an upset stomach after every meal, and most of what I ate wasn&#8217;t worth it! (Dinner at [Rioja](http://www.riojadenver.com/) was a notable exception. Yum!)
