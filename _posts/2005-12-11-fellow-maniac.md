and another fabulous workout goes down in the books!

today was the first sunday I was going to head to CalFit on Karl and 161 for the TBC class &#8211; Michelle did them back when I belonged before, and they&#8217;re a good workout! So I did that for an hour and a half, then headed to the Tennis courts to run. It was about 35 degrees, so naturally I shed my gloves quickly. The path was completely clear, which was in nice contrast to yesterday. As I got to Antrim, however, I saw that they had only cleaned about that 2 mile strip. That cemented by initial plan to run the 5 mile loop 3 times, and then add on an extra mile. So that&#8217;s what I did.. and before long, this mysterious white stuff started falling.

It was gorgeous, I readily admit that. But there was a LOT of snow, and it was that clingy stuff, so I ended up carrying a bunch of it on me. As well, I hadn&#8217;t prepared for precipitation so I was wearing cotton yoga pants, and they got soaked and droopy. I was probably quite a sight! 

I felt really good overall, and was able to maintain about a nine minute pace the whole way. Not bad, considering I even jogged backwards up part of the slope towards 161, just to stretch the ole legs a little (and b/c I was having fun!)

I had initially planned 16 miles, which would have brought me up to an even 40 for the week, but I only got about a minute into that last 5 mile loop before I decided I wasn&#8217;t having that much fun anymore, so I called it quits. I&#8217;m content with a snowy 11 &#8211; after all, I did put in over 3 hours of athletic activity today&#8230;

and now, my new fave Sunday post-workout food: chipotle time!
