Food:  
2 Bananas  
Kefir, Ezekiel cereal with strawberries, chia seeds, hemp seeds  
Ezekiel cinnamon raisin English muffin with peanut butter and Greek yogurt  
2 Hard-boiled eggs  
Quinoa, tempeh, steamed carrots  
Pb chickpea bar  
Cottage cheese  
Orange  
Nectarine  
Dates  
2 Flax carrot apple muffins

Exercise:  
Ran 3 miles in 22:18 (7:51, 7:12, 7:14). I ran the same loop I did a couple weeks ago in 22:30. That time, I threw in some strides, this was more even-effort.

Because I was out of town tues/wed and will be gone again fri-mon, I don&#8217;t have a lot of fresh produce. It actually bothered me enough that I took my lunch break at work at 5 (I work til 6) to run to the store to buy fruit/veggies! Thankfully our hotel will have a fridge so I can load up on healthy eats for the weekend.

I have a nice little lunchkit of protein bars, fruits and veggies, powdered drink mixes, nuts and seeds. Oh, and one piece of Ghirardelli chocolate for Sunday ðŸ™‚ 

I&#8217;ve been eagerly reading the blogs from all the other TBTers (conveniently aggregated at [http://www.facebook.com/90dayTB](http://www.facebook.com/90dayTBT) and see that several of them have said they&#8217;re sore from their workouts. Hrm.. I must not be working hard enough! Granted, I still have the marathoner mentality: you taper and rest in anticipation for a big event. This weekend&#8217;s roller derby tournament is kinda a big deal for me, so I guess I&#8217;m conscious of that. Well, and traveling Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday makes it difficult to find time to hit the gym as well. Hopefully next week I can make the time to really push myself!
