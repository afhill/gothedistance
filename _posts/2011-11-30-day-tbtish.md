I know I&#8217;d said I was going to stop tracking, but I&#8217;ve had two people ask me about food in the past day, so I figured I&#8217;d document it for them ðŸ™‚

6:35 &#8211; breakfast: warm quinoa, ff milk, chia seed, hemp seed, cinnamon. chai tea. Udi&#8217;s oil and liquid kefir probiotic supplements.  
7:15 &#8211; 5 mile run  
9:00 &#8211; second breakfast: &#8211; [curried tofu scramble](http://vegetarian.about.com/od/breakfastrecipe1/r/curriedscramble.htm) with mushrooms, tomato, spinach. Two pieces of dry Ezekiel toast. OJ and chai tea. Also a vegan multi-vitamin, glucosamine, iron and extreme endurance supplements.  
12:30pm &#8211; two [powerballs](http://noticeverything.blogspot.com/2011/04/baseball-powerballs.html), a glass of homemade kombucha  
1:00pm &#8211; spinach salad with carrot, tomato, hemp seed, egg and avocado, balsamic vinegar for dressing. I used to be a Thousand Island girl, but I really feel like the Balsamic makes the flavor pop!  
2:30 &#8211; dried apricots  
3:30 &#8211; baked sweet tofu. Ok its unusual for me to eat this much tofu in a day, but since I had the block, I used it! Also, I didn&#8217;t have a real dinner after running last night.  
5:45 &#8211; blue corn chips  
6:30 &#8211; 4 mile run  
8:00 &#8211; black bean burger with whole wheat bun, cole slaw, beer.
