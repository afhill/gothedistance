Weekends are always crazy with derby, and sometimes the schedule makes it hard to keep up. AND&#8230; I&#8217;m not 100% back on the TBT. I still want to be sure I continue to eat well overall, but if time doesn&#8217;t allow, I&#8217;m not going to see it as a fail.

### Saturday

Saturday was just such a crazy day. Practice from 10-12, hair appointment from 1-3:15, then I was supposed to meet the team at 3:30. That obviously didn&#8217;t quite happen, but I also didn&#8217;t give myself enough time to get a good meal in. Thankfully, Disco had an extra vegetarian sandwich she shared, but it was a panini (white bread) with mozzarella. Not the best, but it could have been worse!

#### Food

  * Ezekiel cereal with kefir and blueberries
  * orange
  * brussel sprouts
  * vega whole food health optimizer
  * eggplant panini with mozzarella
  * a small piece of Boston cream pie cake for Dirt&#8217;s birthday &#8211; note, I&#8217;ve never been a fan of cream pies, but I think I had this just b/c I felt I could. Silly.
  * 2 vitamin waters
  * vegan arepa

#### Exercise

  * 2 hr cuties team practice

### Sunday

Bout day! 

  * protein pancakes with vega whole food health optimizer, blueberries
  * fresh squeezed orange juice
  * iced coffee &#8211; nonfat milk and just a touch of honey for sweetener
  * pre-bout snacks: powerball, blueberries, carrots. I feel like I had more, but I don&#8217;t know what. It was healthy, though. 
  * bazi energy shot
  * a bit of vega sports optimizer before the bottle fell off the table and spilled all over my jersey üôÅ
  * gatorade perform
  * yummy buffet at Eden: sundried tomato polenta, tofu fries with agave dijon and pho sauce, tofu tacos, vegan lasagna. I skipped the eggplant parm (formerly a favorite meal of mine) because cheese just doesn&#8217;t have the same appeal to me anymore
  * beer

#### Exercise

  * jam-jam-jamming against the Oly Rollers. Several folks told me they thought it was the best I&#8217;d ever played!
  * afterparty shenanigans: dancing, yoga (the crow), pushups with feet elevated, attempting to learn the forward worm
