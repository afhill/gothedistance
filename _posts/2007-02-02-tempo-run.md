Last night I had two options for my run:  
8miles with 4 miles at HMP, or 4mile tempo run. So the jist was the same, I had to do 4 miles fast. I ended up at the gym &#8211; the Lifestyle Family Fitness o Hamilton Road has individuals tv screens on every piece of cardio equipment &#8211; but I had loaded up my MP3 player with a few episodes of Phedippidations (I think I&#8217;m now completely caught up) so I was content with that.

1mile warmup @9:14pace  
2miles @ 7:18  
.5 @ 9:14  
2miles @ 7:18  
1mile cooldown @9:14 pace

Overall, it felt ok. I&#8217;ll admit, I didn&#8217;t feel invincible, or I wouldn&#8217;t have taken that break in the middle, but the second two miles actually felt easier than the first. 

I was also pleasantly surprised to hear my blog listed as the Phedippidations featured blog of the week in Episode 81. I had to grin as a ran along listening to myself being talked about ðŸ™‚
