The email circulating around my running gang &#8211; I&#8217;ll certainly miss their friendship!

> Hi, everybody. You&#8217;ve probably all heard the news by now &#8211; Andrea Hill, a key cog in our running machine, is moving on to new challenges in the west. Andrea is going to conquer some exciting new career opportunities and some more demanding running terrain in the Denver area; she&#8217;ll be leaving sometime in the next few weeks. Andrea has been running with us for many years and many miles now, and we&#8217;re going to miss her. We wanted to send her off in style and give her some pleasant memories of the running group here (it&#8217;s never too late) so we thought a Highbanks cookout might be just the thing*. This is just an early warning &#8211; we&#8217;re planning on doing the cookout on Saturday the 27th &#8211; a week from Saturday, not this weekend. Bridget has promised some sort of egg-based goodness, Andy and Mike can probably be persuaded to reprise their popular potatoes and pancakes, respectively, there will be some bacon or sausage somewhere in the mix, and I may have to bring my waffle iron out of retirement. We&#8217;ll run a loop or two at Highbanks and then gather around the fire for some steady gorging and talking. Yeah, that&#8217;s just the way we do things here. Take that, Denver! Ohh, that reminds me, we may have to put together a Columbus Omelette to challenge those Denver folks. Send me your nominations for ingredients.
> 
> Anyway, reserve the date. Stop by and wish Andrea well, share a story of some crazy race she talked you into trying, join in for as much or little of the run and/or feasting as you can.
> 
> *historical footnote &#8211; for a while, Andrea was a vegetarian. Then one day we had a Highbanks cookout, a week before the Columbus marathon (or maybe it was Boston), and Andrea brought some of those vegetarian sausage patties. It was generally agreed that they were pretty good, provided they were fried up in the giant pool of bacon grease that was sitting in the skillet. Faced with this incontrovertible deliciousness, Andrea took the only logical step and moved from the herbivore to the omnivore column. Bacon &#8211; the unstoppable force.
