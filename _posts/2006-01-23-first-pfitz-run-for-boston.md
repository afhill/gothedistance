The alarm woke me up at a bright at cheery 4:55. I actually got out of bed within about 10 min, and headed out for my first run: _General aerobic + speed &#8211; 8 mi w/ 8 x 100m strides_. Actually, the schedule called for 10 strides, but I just noticed that now and I only did 8 this morning. Ah well!

Ran from my apartment to Oakland Park Ave, just past North Broadway. It was actually reasonable weather out, and I wore my camelbak to prepare for the weekend. It worked out well; often after I run in the morning I feel thirsty all day, I was all right today.

Out: 37:23  
Back: 34:35 (the back had the strides)

There is just a certain sense of accomplishment having your daily run completed by 6:30, before most people are rolling out of bed..
