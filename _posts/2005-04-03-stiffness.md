I haven&#8217;t run since Sunday b/c of my strep throat, and my left leg seems to be getting more and more stiff. I feel like I can&#8217;t bend it all the way, and I can only assume this is b/c I haven&#8217;t been running. How interesting that my body seems to NEED the workout now!

I was planning on hitting the treadmill for a bit today anyway, so hopefully it will feel better.
