Today I met Meredith for our Wednesday run, but rather than the midweek easy 12 miler, we decided to do speedwork instead.

10 miles, with 4&#215;1200 @ 5K pace (w/ 800s between)

gulp! It&#8217;s been along time since I hit the track, and neither of us had run since the race Sunday. But I knew I needed to get in some speedwork, so off I went.

We did an easy 2.5 warmup. I felt a little stiff in my knee, but overall pretty good. Then we started our 1200s. They were supposed to be 5:15 in total, so 1:45 per 400. 

1: 1:45, 1:43, 1:41 &#8212; 5:09  
2: 1:41, 1:44,1:42 &#8212; 5:07  
3: 1:41, 1:47, 1:42 &#8212; 5:10  
4: 1:42, 1:49*, 1:41 &#8212; 5:12

* I dropped my hat, turned around and picked it up and put it back on, then continued on.

We then did a nice 3 mile cooldown. My quads felt a little tight, but overall I felt good. 

I was happy with how it went. I really tried to stick to the 1:45s, despite Meredith&#8217;s tendancy to speed up, especially in the last 400. I felt pretty strong, and I actually asked her when her next speed workout was scheduled. I definitely think I need to get another one or two in over the next few weeks!
