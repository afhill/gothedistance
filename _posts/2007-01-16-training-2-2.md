So two weeks ago I did just shy of 10 miles in a week  
Last week I did 3 on Monday, 8 on Tuesday, 9.5 on Friday and 6 on Saturday for a total of 26.5.

Yesterday I did a 1mile warmup, 3 miles at a 7:24 pace (I did stop for a short walk between th 1st and 2nd and 3rd miles of the tempo pace) and .8mile cooldown &#8212; 5 miles in 42min. 

Overall it felt ok. Not &#8216;comfortable&#8217;, per se, but it&#8217;s not as though running on a treadmill ever is! Actually, after the first mile it felt alot easier. I definitely am glad I did the workout, I know speed needs to be my focus right now.
