Hard to believe I was at Disney a year ago, doing the Goofy Challenge (or &#8220;dopey&#8221; as one worker called it, as I did the 5K as well). This year, the 5K was held on Friday, so if you wanted to do all of them, I guess you&#8217;d have to spend one more day there. I&#8217;m not sure if I think that&#8217;s a good idea or not.. I hope the weather is nicer for participants this year than it was last!
