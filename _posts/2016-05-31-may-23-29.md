I&#8217;m enjoying this little bit of accountability, even if no one reads these but me ðŸ™‚

Mon: rest (I was a bit sore after the Barr Trail run on Sunday)

Tues: Interval run w/ Rev Running. The workout was 7min @ 10K pace, then 6x90sec @ 5K pace. I thought I wanted about 7:30 / 7ish paces  
7min: 7:22 pace  
x1: 6:53 pace  
x2: 6:53 pace  
x3: 6:58 pace  
x4: 6:54 pace  
x5: 6:33 pace  
x6: (leave it all on the track): 6:18 pace  
Afterwards, they held a beer mile (with relay options). I did NOT participate, but it was fun to watch ðŸ™‚  
Total: 4.75 miles

Wed: 4 miles @ 9:17

Thurs: wasnt feeling good AT ALL and it was threatening to downpour, so rest. I did buy new [Hokas](http://www.hokaoneone.com/sale/clifton-2/1008329.html?dwvar_1008329_color=NPAC#q=clifton+2&start=1&cgid=) (the Clifton 2), so that counts for something, right?

Fri: 5 miles @ 8:59

Sat: Sara and I ran downtown to my work, had brunch and then took the train home. 10 miles @ 9:17

This time we decided to run up for about 90 min to see how far we could get. (We started at the bottom of the Barr Trail Trailhead). I realized that I could probably make it up 5, so I set that as a goal. I hit the 5th mile marker right around 1:20, so I stopped there, sat down and enjoyed half a bobobar (and took a selfie!), rested a bit and then headed down.  
I felt SO MUCH BETTER than last week on the downhills! (well, through all of it.) That&#8217;s why we train, I guess! Last week the downhills miles were all over 13 min, so even though we went longer this time, I was faster than last week on those same miles.  
Just for fun, here&#8217;s my splits:  
x1: 16:12  
x2: 17:49  
x3: 17:04  
x4: 16:23  
x5: 12:36  
x6: 10:57  
x7: 10:35  
x8: 12:37  
x9: 12:11  
x10: 8:23  
&#8212;-  
1:20 up (16mm)  
:58 down (just shy of 12mm)

Made it back north of 30 mpw for the first time in awhile&#8230; and was pleasantly surprised with pulling back-to-back 10s. Sure, trails are easier on the joints, but I was on my feet for a heck of a lot longer! I&#8217;m really glad we&#8217;re already getting some good training runs in; I look forward to seeing how it all pans out in August! I was thinking that it&#8217;d be a great focus to really see what I could do in the Ascent&#8230;.
