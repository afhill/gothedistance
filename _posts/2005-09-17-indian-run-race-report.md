That was so much fun!

Hit the road at 7 this morning to drive the 1.25 hrs to Hocking HIlls for the Indian Run(s). This weekend my training schedule called for 20 miles, so I decided to substitute a 10K and a 20K on hilly trails and call it even.

Arrived at the lodge around 8:30, nicely got registered and on the bus that would take us out to the 10K start. Because it&#8217;s trail running, there was no set start time so the trails would not be too congested. We could start anytime between 9 and 11, and it was all chip-timed. That was how I was going to manage to run both; I started the 10K at right after 9 and just had to be sure to start the 20K before 11 (it started where the 10K ended). 

I chatted with a few women before we set off. One of them had run the 20K before and she warned me about Steel Hill&#8230; I&#8217;d heard alot about Steel Hill, so I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to it. We set off in a wave of 6 or 7, and before too long I left the women behind. I knew I had a lot of running ahead of me, so I wasn&#8217;t too aggressive.

There were a few places where I wasn&#8217;t sure what route to take, and at one point a guy I was following was going the wrong way, until I noticed some orange flags on the other side of some (dried) creek. So we did some off-roading. 

There were a few water stops, which was nice. It was odd b/c they didn&#8217;t have mile markers to let you know how far you&#8217;d gone, but the water stops were measured (2.59 miles til the next stop, 1.14 miles til the next stop &#8212; yes, they were that precise). I decided to take it easy and walked through each stop, even stopping to drink most of the water before throwing the cup away. 

I was actually surprised, there was a fair amount of the run on the road. It disappointed me, actually. At one point I caught up to some guy as we were running up some stairs. I asked him &#8220;who put these here?&#8221; He chuckled and said &#8220;I&#8217;m more concerned about what&#8217;s coming up next&#8221;. We got up the stairs and were spat out onto the road. He told me to go ahead, and I asked if that meant he knew something I didn&#8217;t know. He told me it was a mile long incline. As I trudged up the road, I decided that they should have made this a 5 mile run, because this last mile on a state route with cars tearing by wasn&#8217;t fun.

10K time: 56:12 &#8211; 9:04 pace  
First in my age group, 4th woman overall

I took some water, a gu (my 2nd of the day), an orange slice, a quick bathroom break and was on the 20K starting line by 10:15. 

I started out feeling reasonably strong, at the front of my wave. I told myself I&#8217;d already warmed up ðŸ™‚ We ran up the road&#8230; and down the road.. and up the road.. and down the road. I was passed by my first two runners of the day (they started in my heat). The girl seemed knock-kneed and I wondered if I&#8217;d catch her later. We were easing down a steep incline and she&#8217;d kick it. I felt sorry for her quads, and I wondered if this was what the first leg at Hood to Coast was like. I couldn&#8217;t believe how long we were running on the road, and I decided that there was no way I&#8217;d ever do the 60K here. I&#8217;d have rather run the 10K 6 times than this. 

Eventually we turned off the road and there was Steel Hill. My legs were already tight from holding myself back down the long steep hill, and I didn&#8217;t even attempt to run. I saw the people who&#8217;d passed me far ahead, kicking it up the hill. I knew they were hardcore, and I probably wouldn&#8217;t see them again. I didn&#8217;t. At the top of the hill was a water stop, and I asked how far we&#8217;d gone. They didn&#8217;t know. My watch said 32:xx so I hoped we were over 3 miles (people had told me Steel Hill was the first 2nd or 3rd mile). I kept trucking. I was passed by one other runner at this point.

Pine needles are the nicest surface to run on. Hands down.

Eventually things started to look familiar, and I came to the part where the 10K and 20K run the same route. That was a great moment, because I knew I had a good 7 miles in, and I knew what was coming. I hit a waterstop at 1:04 that had been 9:30 into the first 10K, so I thought I had potentially 45/50 min left. I certainly wasn&#8217;t as fresh as I had been the first time, but I felt pretty good overall. I think I was so excited about this fact, I forgot to take my next gu. I realized it a few min later and even considered turning around. I thought better of that idea, and kept going.

This time I found my way through the trails, and it was good to have things jogging my memory &#8220;this is where that guy slipped&#8221;, &#8220;this is where I took off&#8221; to keep me going. I walked a tiny bit coming up to the last water stop, took my gu, and started off&#8230; in the wrong direction. Luckily the water guy noticed before too long and they yelled at me. What the heck? As I thanked him and turned back around I said &#8220;the sad thing is, I already came by here once today&#8221;. I was running through a campground and some guy asked if I was doing the 10K. I said &#8220;20&#8221; and I think he was impressed. If only he knew I was actually close to mile 15. 

When I hit the trails again after the campground bit, I knew I was pretty close. My mind was still keeping track of the course by earlier events &#8220;this is where that kid was&#8221; &#8220;up there is the hill where I saw the guy in the red shirt&#8221;. I did find that I was being less careful about my footing. Often after running for a few hours, my mind starts to wander a bit, I disassociate. This doesn&#8217;t seem like a really good thing when you&#8217;re running trails. I was ok, but rather than concentrating on what I was doing, I think I just slowed down so that I didn&#8217;t slip or anything.

Oh look, there&#8217;s those darned steps. Almost done! 

I don&#8217;t know if Red Shirt Guy actually knew that that last stretch was a mile, but I restarted my watch anyway. I was at 1:46:xx. My goal for the 20K had been sub-2 hrs, to run the same pace as for the 10K would have been 1:52. I knew the 1:52 wasn&#8217;t going to happen (and had never even seriously considered it). Now I was stuck firmly in that range, with a mile (?) to go. Felt good. Then I turned a corner and there was a herd of runners up ahead. A sly grin came over me: they had no idea I&#8217;m sure they were roadkill.

I passed one guy when he slowed to a walk, told him he was going great, ran a few more metres and slowed to a walk myself. I knew the finish chute wasn&#8217;t too far ahead and I wanted to finish strong. Set myself a &#8216;restart&#8217; point and when I got there, I gunned it. Passed three of the runners before I even hit the chute. One more as I turned into the final stretch, and up 150m ahead was a guy close to the gate. This was going to be fun.

I had my homemade &#8220;medal&#8221; placed over my head by the &#8220;Indian&#8221; just as he was stopping his watch. Sorry, guy!

20K time: 1:56:38 &#8211; 9:24 pace  
Second in my age group, 8th woman out of 53  
I felt pretty good overall, and I was happy with my time. I was glad that I seemed to maintain a reasonably steady pace through the two races. 

I hung out for a little bit, and they posted the 5K and 10K results. Considered getting a massage, but there was a bit of a line so I just headed out. The drive home was nice and relaxing; I stopped at an antique mall/flea market, just relaxed and enjoyed what I had accomplished.

Boy, imagine how great I&#8217;ll feel in three weeks with what I accomplish then&#8230; Taper Time!
