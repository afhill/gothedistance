Rolling right along! I am going to track my info on LiveStrong, but there&#8217;s still something rewarding about doing a wrap-up here. 

I had such good plans for today: I prepped dinner ([garbanzo stew](http://www.slow-cooker.com/garbanzo-stew.html)) in the slow cooker before heading to work, and packed lunch. But the boss ordered in Chipotle so I went with that instead. It&#8217;s ridiculous how I can make brown rice and black beans (in fact, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d been planning on) and have it come out waaay more healthy than ordering from somewhere. The salsas, while delicious, are crazy high in sodium (my mild tomato and corn weigh in at over 1000g of sodium&#8230;). And because I ate so much at lunch, I missed my snacks and ended up eating larger meals. I definitely think I feel better with my smaller snacks. 

It was a long day so I just got in my PT exercises. Tomorrow I&#8217;m off to Better Bodies, and then I have practice. The PT said either tomorrow or Thursday I can try running for 2 miles to see how I feel. I know I feel much stronger than before all this, likely as a combination of working out and diet. I&#8217;m definitely motivated to keep it up!
