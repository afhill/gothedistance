Last night I was feeling a bit discouraged about things, so I decided today would be a focused day. Went to the gym to work on my bench press for the Pump and Run. In less than a month, I want to be able to bench press 30x80lbs. Here&#8217;s what I did today to try to get there. I&#8217;m still struggling a bit with what I most need to work on: strength or endurance. I think the endurance is probably key, regardless of the weight I seem to be limited by a number of reps. Yet mentally I feel like doing 30x45lbs isn&#8217;t &#8220;enough&#8221; to get me ready. I am doing a ton of reps while at the gym, and I THINK it&#8217;s helping. For example, today overall I did 196 reps total, averaging probably 50lbs. If I can mentally get prepared for only 30, hard, I&#8217;m hoping my muscles will comply. 

Incidentally, despite the fact I&#8217;ve really been primarily focused on chest this past month, I&#8217;m seeing WAY more definition in my arms and shoulders. Love it! 

I weighed myself clothed at the gym before my workout and it was 118.2. Dammit &#8211; I am really banking on being under 117 for the event. Today I had a fleeting thought wondering if it would be possible for me to get down to 113- that would probably be 111 without clothes. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s feasible, but boy would it make the event easier! (Then I&#8217;d only have to bench 75lbs)

    9:00pm: harvest chai. I thought I was being good by choosing the &#8220;dairy-free&#8221; chai. Except it was made with apple cider. Which = sugar. Dangit&#8230;  
    11:00pm: veggie juice: cucumber, apple, ginger. I&#8217;ve made juice every day since I got my juicer, didn&#8217;t want to break the streak!
    
    My run today went great! Not sure if it was leftover energy from the supplements this morning. I was fast and felt like I could have gone longer. The one negative was that my route includes a 2.5 mile loop, and I left my jacket hidden behind a statue when I did the loop. 20 minutes later I came back and it was gone. Grr&#8230; I&#8217;m trying to tell myself it was some poor homeless starving orphan whose life will be bettered by owning a Brooks running jacket&#8230;
