Close call today: I thought about making it a cheat day in case people decided to go for a drink after bootcamp, but that didn&#8217;t happen. Glad I didn&#8217;t &#8216;waste&#8217; it! (I had two bites of a breakfast burrito that had cheese in it, but it was gross and I threw the rest away. Warm cheese absolutely just tastes like yucky fattiness at this point. 

#### Food

  * Oatmeal, almond butter, hemp seed, chia seed &#8211; I think the first time I had oatmeal before a race!
  * tea
  * Vega sport performance optimizer pre-race
  * One Jet blackberry Gu during the race
  * A few bites of breakfast burrito: egg, cheese, potatoes. Gross. As hungry as I was, this wasn&#8217;t good
  * Dirty non-fat chai (not Starbucks)
  * 2 Lara bars
  * vitamin water zero
  * Leftover lunch: Glass noodles with almond sauce, Boulder veggie bowl
  * [Mexican power wrap](http://gopalshealthfoods.com/power-wraps/mexican-powerwraps.html) &#8211; Interesting. Not particularly good
  * [Homemade cornbread](http://www.thegraciouspantry.com/clean-eating-corn-bread/) (too dry) and [beet borscht](http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/polishsoups/r/beetsoup.htm)

#### Exercise

  * Half-marathon ([1:50:35](http://onlineraceresults.com/race/view_individual.php?make_printable=1&bib_num=220&race_id=18675&type=result)
  * 1hr derby practice, 1 hr scrimmage (didn&#8217;t play too much b/c we had a pretty big bench)

The Colorado Colfax half-marathon started at 6am, and I figured there was an off-chance I could run the race and go right to bootcamp. However, it was cold and rainy and so I decided I wanted to go home, eat and have a well-deserved nap! I did make it back for an offensive blocking class and scrimmage in the afternoon. I was actually pretty surprised by how fine my legs felt skating! I will admit, I think I like this half distance. I really haven&#8217;t been running much but it didn&#8217;t kill me, and mentally it was a pretty great race. How great to hit the 4 mile mark and know you&#8217;re well over a quarter done!
