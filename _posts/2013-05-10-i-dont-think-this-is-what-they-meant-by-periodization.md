Sports periodization refers to focusing on particular aspects during a training cycle. Back when I was training following the Pfitzinger Advanced Marathoning plan, there were several discrete phases to the program:  
Mesocycle 1: Endurance  
Mesocycle 2: Lactate Threshold and Endurance  
Mesocycle 3: Race Preparation  
Mesocycle 4: Taper and Race

The idea is that each cycle has a particular focus to help you get to the place you need to be. 

So what periodization am I referring to in the title of this post? 

well, so apparently I have my own cycles.  
November 2011: [Start training with Running Republic of Boulder](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/11/i-have-a-coach/) to focus on speed and racing  
September 2012: Quit RRBs because I&#8217;m insecure about racing and want to run for fun  
November 2012: [Start training with Athletics Boulder](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/12/new-beginnings/) to focus on speed and racing  
May 2013: Quit Athletics Boulder because I&#8217;m insecure about racing and want to run for fun

Things are a little different this time around. Last September I waited until I was burnt out and run into the ground. This time I had a breakthrough moment that stressing myself out about races wasn&#8217;t making me happy, and I wanted to stop.  
Uhm&#8230; stop stressing&#8230;Not stop racing. I actually wanted to do MORE races.. just slower. and longer. 

Yes, Marathoner Andrea wants to be back. But unlike back in 2008-2011, I want to actually train for them! Just not the way my training has been going, wherein I stress about living up to timegoals I think I &#8220;should&#8221; be able to hit. 

I had a great talk with [Amy Schneider](http://www.coloradorunnermag.com/2012/06/13/exclusive-athlete-interview-amy-schneider/) after the race last weekend and we talked about trail racing, and I was overwhelmed with a rush of emotion. I&#8217;m missing out on these races I really enjoy&#8230; so I can train and try to race a road race that makes me hate life while I&#8217;m running? That makes no sense.

That&#8217;s not to say I&#8217;m done with training. Just this type of training I&#8217;ve been doing: very structured, with a focus towards pushing myself to the edge on a road race. I certainly want to train to get faster, but in a way that won&#8217;t make me feel like I&#8217;ve lost the race before I even pin on my bib. 

_Honestly, I think I&#8217;d see marked improvement if I just engaged with a sports psych rather than a coach. They probably have those around here in Boulder somewhere.. but in the meantime, I&#8217;m going to just take some time and enjoy the summer in Colorado!_
