I&#8217;m one of those people who mulls things over before she voices them &#8211; and once I say something, the decision is made and I follow through. It&#8217;s actually a dominant part of my personality and it&#8217;s taken me quite awhile to realize not everyone else is like that and I can&#8217;t assume that everyone is fully committed to doing whatever they muse over. But, I&#8217;m learning!

So.. I&#8217;ve mentioned the T word a few times on this blog. Like [here](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/the-reluctant-triathlete/). And [here](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/total-immersion/). And the ultimate end result [here](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/bucket-list/#t).

So because I&#8217;m basically confined to the house, I&#8217;ve been doing my research, reading up on training and equipment. Because now that the statement is out there, I&#8217;ve committed to trying this triathlon stuff out.

One of the big questions is the bike. My bike now is basically a commuter bike &#8211; certainly not anything I&#8217;d want to use for a race. But do I want to get a road bike and mod it for triathlon, or just jump right to the chase and get a tri bike so I don&#8217;t end up wanting to upgrade once I get to racing?

I did a bunch of research and had some ideas of the overall bike environment, and on Sunday night I figured I&#8217;d go check out eBay just to check out prices.

And there she was.

My size, with a bunch of upgraded components. I did a quick check-in with my buddy Eddie and he said it was a good find. So I threw out a bid and went to bed. Any by Monday morning before breakfast, I had a bike!

> **2010 Felt S32** &#8211; It has 200 miles on the road doing triathlons and another 500 miles on the trainer. The rear derailleur has been upgraded to ultegra, the aerobars have been upgraded to blackwell research carbon, and the rims have been upgraded to Zipp 404 (rear)/ Cane Creek (front, same rim as Zipp 404). I will also include the stock felt wheels with this auction for a great training set. This includes 2 sets of brakes, rubber for training wheels and cork for zipp/cane creek set.

I was a mix of emotions &#8211; excitement of course, because I had a new toy, but also some embarrassment. Seriously, did I NEED a triathlon bike? I haven&#8217;t done a triathlon- haven&#8217;t even signed up for one and it certainly wont be for months.. but, I know myself. And I know that I WILL get into it, because I decided I would. Now I have a bike to train and race on, and all that&#8217;s left is getting myself ready!

Since I won her on Canada day, I think she&#8217;s going to need a Canadian name. Maple is too soft. I was thinking Bobsled as that seems very winter-sporty and fast, and I could call her Bob, but I&#8217;m not sold on that yet. Is it strange I can&#8217;t think of a distinctly fast, powerful Canadian name? (She&#8217;s definitely a girl though. I tried to refer to her in a gender-neutral manner and it just didn&#8217;t seem right).

SO. EXCITED!

Geez I hope she fits ðŸ˜‰ That&#8217;s the next step once she arrives from South Carolina &#8211; going for a real bike fit. You know, once I can walk into a store and pedal&#8230;
