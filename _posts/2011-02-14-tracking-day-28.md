Sometimes, this blog eats my posts before I save them. üôÅ I&#8217;m less articulate the second time around.

Food:  
Ezekiel almond cereal with kefir, hemp seed and wheat germ  
green tea  
2 chocolates (it IS Valentine&#8217;s day!) Our boss brought in chocolate, cupcakes and cookies, and the admin brought in fruit üôÇ  
2 oranges  
some watermelon and green grapes  
Odwalla Green superfood drink  
whole wheat sandwich pockets stuffed with brown rice, black beans, spinach, tomato, green pea guac, and bean sprouts  
lentil chips and light havarti  
almonds  
[cocohydro instant coconut water](http://www.cocohydro.com/) &#8211; I&#8217;ve been wondering about my electrolytes lately.  
probar superfood slam bar  
honeycrisp apple  
ABC &#8216;protein&#8217; bar  
pita pocket with steamed spinach, black beans and muenster cheese

I wanted to do abs this morning, but I didn&#8217;t quite get to it. After work I had derby practice, although I&#8217;m still off-contact so I didn&#8217;t skate the whole two hours. Tomorrow is a big day: PT, bootcamp and a deep tissue massage. I&#8217;m getting worked over!! Then on Thursday I&#8217;m meeting with Eli, the personal trainer at the gym that Frida met with the other day. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what he has to say.
