I just bought a FitSense speedometer online &#8211; I&#8217;d been eying them for awhile, and I came across one on half.com today for $100 less than they are new, so I ponied up and got it. I had been planning on saving up for it, but I couldn&#8217;t pass up the deal, since I&#8217;d been looking online for them for awhile and hadn&#8217;t found any used.

This thing is pretty slick, I&#8217;ve read lots of good stuff about them. It&#8217;s a speedometer, but doesn&#8217;t use GPS so it doesn&#8217;t lose its signal. It has a heart-rate monitor, and a computer link to track your heart rate, pace, etc per run. 

I&#8217;m pretty excited about my new <strike>toy</strike> tool.
