_A friend gave me this poem framed for Christmas, I quite like it_

**Why Do I Run?**  
Those who don&#8217;t can&#8217;t understnd the pain is real every day  
Is it easier now? Not really.  
The same pain I felt the first day I began.  
Only easier now to cover greater distances in shorter periods of time.  
The pain is the same, and I understand it always will be. I dread it, and in a sense I crave it.

Why do I run? To stay in shape, to keep my health, to feel better &#8212; all partial reasons, I suppose. The reason is confirmation. Confirmation that I am in control.  
Every day I must make a choice &#8212; a choice to experience pain and discomfort in order to achieve a higher goal or to give into the body&#8217;s urging to do something else more comforting and pleasurable.

Who is in control? My body or me? Every time I run, I verify to myself that I am in control and that I can be the master of my own destiny.  
That is ultimately why I run. I feel guilty when I don&#8217;t run &#8212; When the body wins.  
Running is a test of my strenth &#8212; not just my physical &#8212; but my mental.  
Running is a challenge of my &#8220;will&#8221; &#8212; of mind over matter, of me against myself.  
Running is mental conditioning as well as physical.  
It&#8217;s therapy of the &#8220;will&#8221; for me.

Each run is success &#8212; the richest and most deeply satisfying.  
Strangely but unmistakably tied to self-discipline, self-denial and self-control. In a world whre I often feel helpless, victimized and controlled, running helps revive feelings of hope, strength, and conviction that I can make a difference and I can be responsible for me. An addiction or choice, you may say. And you&#8217;re right &#8212; there&#8217;s a danger.

So long as I &#8220;choose&#8221;, the value remains true and real; so long as I control running and not let running control me. Positive addiction or not, the value is choosing. When the choice is gone, I become controlled and victimized again &#8212; one more thing in my life that tells me I am not in control, that I am simply a pawn of fate and circumstance. I must run as a choice, not out of necessity &#8212; or its real value again is gone for me.

Why Do I Run?  
I run for success &#8212; success in the ultimate contest; the contest of me against myself.
