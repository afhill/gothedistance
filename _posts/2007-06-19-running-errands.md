Despite my renewed enthusiasm for running, I took yesterday off. I remember how the day after a &#8216;hard&#8217; run can be less than pleasurable (or beneficial!) This morning I decided to run an errand, so I headed out to the bank on foot. At first my knee felt &#8216;blocked&#8217;, fairly normal for me after a good workout. It never hurt, however, and it definitely got better as it went on. 

As I ran, I admit I realized the distance was a bit further than I thought, but I was glad I ran it. When I got back, I checked the [gmap-pedometer](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/) and it was actually 1.51 miles each way. So I actually got in a pretty decent &#8216;easy&#8217; run!
