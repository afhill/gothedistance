It&#8217;s funny how quickly apprehension can build. I&#8217;ve missed the last few group workouts with [Athletics Boulder](http://athleticsboulder.org), and I was a bit nervous to join them today. We had a track workout planned, but due to some surprise snowfall-turned-ice we had to move to the roads. The workout became 12x400m with a mere 40sec recovery between. 

There weren&#8217;t many of us: Adam, Rick and Laura, Cheri, Robert and Cathy. We ended up in our normal clumps: Adam ahead, Robert and Cathy together at the back and the fab four of us in the middle running together. 

I felt great and stayed second to Rick for nearly every set; the second-to-last Cheri took off and killed it, but the last I finished neck-to- neck with Rick. I was surprised how consistent my time was. The last couple seemed tough but I stayed strong. 

It was fun to run with the group again with Jay encouraging us and calling out feedback. Twice he told me to stay tall, after the second time I joked back &#8220;this is as tall as I am!&#8221; which elicited giggles from Cheri. 

I know 400m is short, but I&#8217;m pretty content with my pace &#8211; which was consistently faster than my 5K pace (which is 6:23 at sea level):

1. 1:33 (6:15mm)  
2. 1:34 (6:10mm)  
3. 1:36 (6:18mm)  
4. 1:34 (6:09mm)  
5. 1:34 (6:12mm)  
6. 1:32 (6:03mm)  
7. 1:34 (6:14mm &#8211; then he told us to pick it up)  
8. 1:30 (5:59mm)  
9. 1:33 (6:06mm)  
10. 1:30 (5:52mm)  
11. 1:31(6:01mm)  
12. 1:26 (5:42mm)

Overall I felt great after &#8211; which I guess isn&#8217;t that unusual on this short stuff. I definitely seem to do better at it than some of our longer workouts. Some part of me also remembers that I seem to do a bit better when I&#8217;m a bit more rested &#8211; the ongoing balance of building endurance and building speed&#8230;
