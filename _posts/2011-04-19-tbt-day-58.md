I&#8217;d planned to get up early and go for a run, but didn&#8217;t get to bed til late last night, and when I woke up I felt just a general achiness so I decided to call it a rest day. Although, I did do abs and went to MHC practice. I didn&#8217;t feel great there either; my hips felt tight and I had this nagging fear of getting injured. I was fine all last week though, including the bout, so I&#8217;m not going to get too worked up about it. I WILL be using the foam roller after this update is complete, though!
