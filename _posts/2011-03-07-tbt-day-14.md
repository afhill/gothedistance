I&#8217;m still not great at cheat days. I still want to eat healthy, just have a few additional non-good items. My team knew it was my cheat day, and they joked after our bout I was going to go stick my head under the nacho cheese pump. They actually cheered when I walked over with a plate of chili cheese fries (they werent mine, I was carrying them with a friend).  
The big reason I chose today as a cheat day was to be able to drink, though the cheese and chocolate was a welcome treat. I still dove into my snackbag rather than buying crap.  
Funniest thing today: the ref checking our numbers commented on my muscles. I flexed and he said &#8220;it&#8217;s like peas tied to a piece of spaghetti&#8221;. Apparently he didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be insulted by that??
