so yeah, 18 miles didn&#8217;t happen yesterday. and as of 9pm, no miles had happened today. Once I miss a day, I feel a bit bummed, and it can be hard to get back on track. Mostly because I don&#8217;t know if I should get back on the track at the point I got off, or if I should use the next on-ramp ðŸ™‚

So I missed this week&#8217;s long run.. generally on Tuesdays I do a &#8220;speed&#8221; workout, but I don&#8217;t know if it would be more important to try to just in more miles. This month I&#8217;m in training from 9-4:30 everyday, so if I wanted to try to get in a ton of miles during the week, I&#8217;d probably have to do a 2-a-day. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m totally into that, although I better decide in the next half hour if I&#8217;m going to get up early to do so..  
&#8230;hm, don&#8217;t foresee that happening&#8230;

So I guess tomorrow I&#8217;ll try for speed, since all my runs since Friday have been outside in snow/slush. I just think that my training is lacking in distance.. but I guess that will come&#8230; 

I did bike again for 45 min after my 3 mile run, so I guess I am getting some endurance in&#8230;
