So, although I haven&#8217;t gone too crazy with my diet or slacked too much in the exercise department, the idea of continuing the TBT has seemed less appealing with each passing day. 

The fact is, the TBT was a program to transform your body within a set timeframe. I&#8217;m happy with the body I came out of the program with, but I don&#8217;t foresee any more further really remarkable change, for a few reasons:

1. The next few months I have tons of races and bouts to play. Instead of focusing on lifting, I want to work on explosive power, as well as endurance. Those will be demonstrated through times and points, not photographs.  
I still plan to eat healthily &#8211; but you can follow the Eat Clean diet without being on the TBT &#8211; my Mom did, and lost a good 9 pounds in only a few weeks! (She may not like me sharing this, but she now weighs what I saw as my TBT target weight. We Hills are tiny folk). But, I may also stray from eating clean from time to time, if I want. Not having crazy cheat days where I end up feeling like crap, but especially in the summer, if I want to have a drink with friends on a patio, I will. 

The one thing a lot of my reading has really drilled into my head, though, that I won&#8217;t ignore, is the impact of the food we take in. If I caffeinate (as I did Sunday before the bout), I will be sure to take maca or some other adrenal support to help my cortisol levels get back nice and low. I&#8217;ll continue to take protein after working out to help with recovery. There are so many good &#8220;extras&#8221; I can do to look after myself, although obviously continuing to eat well will also help. As I (sorta) mentioned yesterday, I am still trying to stay away from cheese, it just doesn&#8217;t hold the same allure for me.  
I feel that even on the TBT, my food started to get less healthy near the end: at the beginning I was having good hearty oatmeal breakfasts, then brown rice and a veggie for lunch &#8211; by the end, I was eating a lot of things like hemp or lentil chips.. not totally junk food, but definitely not as nutritionally dense as they could be. The fact is, if I want to be a healthy eater, I don&#8217;t need a blog to enforce that. I now have 4 unopened gourmet chocolate bars in my fridge, and I haven&#8217;t gorged on them. I don&#8217;t need to. 

I&#8217;ve blogged, like, forever. So when I come up with something I think is worthy of sharing &#8211; a great workout, recipe, or reflection, I&#8217;ll post it here. But I think I&#8217;ll be serving more of a supportive role in the next round of TBT gals are starting on than tracking my own. 

Failing to plan is planning to fail, and without truly having a goal to transform this body, I can&#8217;t see that I&#8217;ll see the effort as a success.
