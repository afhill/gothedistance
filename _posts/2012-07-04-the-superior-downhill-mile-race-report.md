Today was the Superior Downhill Mile, which bills itself as &#8220;the Fastest Street Mile in the United States&#8221;. There were no turns, and almost a 200ft elevation drop. I&#8217;ve been wanting to run a mile for awhile, so I figured this was one to try!

I was buying some Hoka One One shoes when I registered, and the sales guy suggested I even wear them in the race. I was a bit skeptical, but last week an email went out saying that since Hoka was a sponsor, the first male and female finishers wearing the shoes would win $100! Ok, that made my footwear decision for me!

Last week when I met Darren to discuss my goals, he recommended I run both the mile and the Avery 4 on the 4th, so this was my first of two races for the day, and second of three races within five days. Whoops!

I went to bed unsure how aggressively I&#8217;d race. My alarm didn&#8217;t go off but I woke up on my own and dragged myself out of bed. The event start was only about 10 minutes from home so I arrived in plenty of time &#8211; enough to even go to a nearby gas station for some coffee! 

I warmed up a bit but nothing too intense; I didn&#8217;t want to risk burning out my legs before we started! Soon it was time to go. The race was chip-timed but that didn&#8217;t alleviate all the congestion at the start (why do little kids always think they&#8217;re the fastest???). They had the quarters marked off, which was cool. I&#8217;d read a race report that said that the first was the fastest, the second and third were more flat and the fourth was again quite fast. Cool!

I hit the first quarter in 1:14, and the halfway point in 2:44. I chugged along and passed some folks who were struggling in the second half, and remembered a time when I too [walked in a mile race](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2007/07/one-mile-dash-or-how-i-hate-running-fast/). 

The timers called out &#8220;5:24&#8221; as the gal ahead of me cruised across the line. That&#8217;s some nice improvement over the 5:58 I ran last year at the [Metro Mile](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/07/metro-mile-race-report/)! However, I feel like I can&#8217;t really assess how much better since the course was so amenable to speed. 

I chatted with Diane for a bit at the end (she ran 5:11!), and we commented on how we didn&#8217;t see any other women wearing Hokas. I went over to the race organizer and he handed me a check! My first winnings! 

I felt surprisingly good, coughed a few times but not nearly as bad as after last year&#8217;s mile, and headed back up the hill to the car. I had another race to run! 

Honestly, I feel a bit weird about my time. I know it&#8217;s a measured course and therefore theoretically this is a PR, but it seems like it wasn&#8217;t all &#8220;me&#8221;, does that make sense? 

Results (my division was F20-39.. what the heck???)
