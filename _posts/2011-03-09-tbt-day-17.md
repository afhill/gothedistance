Today was my shoulders day, though I threw in a few chest and back exercises as well. I know I want to have a legs day, a biceps/triceps day and a shoulders day, haven&#8217;t yet figured out where the rest of my body fits into that&#8230; And I also need to get better at having a plan before I show up at the gym. I loooove upright rows but I forgot to do them!
