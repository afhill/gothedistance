I haven&#8217;t done one of these posts in forever! But since I&#8217;m settling back into training and blogging, may as well!

Had a pretty big month, getting in a lot of miles, and a lot of quality workouts. I feel strong, and expect the numbers to continue to ratchet up as I continue to train with RRB. 

I ran 21/30 days. My average run distance was 8 miles per run, although I did 2 18 milers.  
I ran a 10K race and set a big PR.
