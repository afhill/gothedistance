&#8220;The human body can do so much. Then the heart and spirit must take over.&#8221; Sohn Kee-Chung

&#8220;In running, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you come in first, in the middle of the pack or last. You can say, &#8216;I have finished.&#8217; There is a lot of satisfaction in that.&#8221; Fred Lebow
