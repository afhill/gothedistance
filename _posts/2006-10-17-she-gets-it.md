My mom has been running a fair amount lately: she actually ran a 5K PR on Sunday! For her birthday I sent her John Bingham&#8217;s &#8220;No Need for Speed&#8221; and she stayed up late the next night reading it ðŸ™‚ This morning I had the nicest email in my inbox, and I agree with her completely:

_One of the things in the book you gave me was why people run. I realized I run because I love it. I always come home feeling good about myself. The other is the people I run with. It was really nice yesterday after the run to meet three other ladies from our clinic who also ran and even though we didn&#8217;t all run together, we were happy to see each other and happy that everyone finished and had done well. I actually ran with a lady from the clinic that I didn&#8217;t find easy to get to know butÂ  really enjoyed my day with her. We went in later and had our little snack together (with dad as well:)) and enjoyed her company. When we were leaving I thanked her for running with me and she gave me a hug. The people are just so nice that run.(one&#8217;s in my clinic anyway:)._
