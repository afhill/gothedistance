I&#8217;m not going to do a &#8216;real&#8217; poll, since I think you have to have an LJ to respond. Plus, this way people can leave details.

So my Mom is considering doing a &#8220;run a half marathon&#8221; clinic. Her biggest concern is that they recommend you run 5 days a week. She; sjust worried about being able to do the commitment. (I&#8217;m not sure if she&#8217;s concerned about overuse)

I told her that I thought that was plenty, and she could get away with less. I followed Hal Higdon&#8217;s Novice Half Marathon plan when I was starting up running again, and I only ran maybe 3 days a week (I cross-trained quite a bit). So I want to know:

**How many days a week do you run (in training for a half)?**

Heck, I don&#8217;t even think I run 5 days when I&#8217;m in marathon training, but I think I&#8217;m a bit of an anomaly in that respect&#8230;
