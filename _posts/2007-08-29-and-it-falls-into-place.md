so I had to be creative with my [running schedule](http://www.afhill.com/running/oct_pfitz2007.htm#meso2) this week, figuring out how to maximize my time after last week&#8217;s &#8216;fall-back&#8217; week. I am going to head out for 15 miles with Meredith and Mary today- they are doing their long run today, I was hoping to catch up with last week&#8217;s, and still get in one this weekend. Looking at my training schedule, this weekend should be a 10K tune-up race one day, with a 17 miler the next. I didnt think I was very likely to find a 10K race&#8230; and lo and behold, I got an email for the [Buckeye Classic 10K](http://www.runwildracing.com/RaceInfo.asp?nRaceID=128) today! It&#8217;s on Sunday, and with the holiday, I could fit in the 17miler on Monday. As well, it gives me one more day of recovery between the 15miler today and the weekend. Sweet!
