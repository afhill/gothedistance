I&#8217;m in the homestretch!! 

#### Food

  * Smoothie: egg whites, kefir, apple, grapefruit, banana, hemp protein powder, wheat germ, chia seed, hemp seed
  * naked breakfast burrito &#8211; egg, potato, veggie chili, black bean salad, guacamole, mild salsa with rice and bean snack chips. Whole foods was out of whole wheat tortillas??
  * tea
  * apple
  * the end of the leftover glass noodles and almond sauce &#8211; finally!
  * trail mix
  * banana
  * hummus, pita and veggies. I&#8217;d vowed never to spend money on hummus out again, but the Jake&#8217;s menu isn&#8217;t terribly TBT-friendly

#### Exercise

  * 2 30-min Mad Abs classes (one at lunch, one after work). I wanted to stay for the &#8220;Dirty thirty&#8221; circuit at lunch as well, but there were a bunch of box jumps on the plan and I knew my legs would never forgive me. The classes were different, but both good. One was more about planks (balance/stability) and the other was more focused on crunches. Both had some good lower-ab exercises.
