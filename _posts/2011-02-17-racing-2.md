I told myself, shorter races this year. And after feeling how good and strong I feel doing more strength training, I&#8217;m excited about focusing on shorter, faster runs. Added bonus: they&#8217;re also cheaper!

I&#8217;m eying the [Colorado Masters Series](http://www.comastersrun.org/Run_Schedule_2011.html) as well as the [Colorado Runner Racing Series](http://www.coloradorunnermag.com/2011-colorado-runner-racing-series). For the racing series, I already have 70 points from my placement in the run last weekend. I am planning to run the [Snowman Stampede 5 miler](http://winterdistanceseries.com/Snowman/) this Saturday as well.
