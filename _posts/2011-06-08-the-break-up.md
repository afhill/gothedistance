Today was my last session with my trainer. It was supposed to have been last week, but I canceled on her. I&#8217;d been apprehensive about &#8216;the last day&#8217; &#8211; although I&#8217;d decided I didn&#8217;t want to continue with her for now, I felt bad about it.  
Then after I canceled last week, I was surprised at the response back: she&#8217;d actually gotten her &#8216;dream job&#8217; and that Wednesday (my final session) was supposed to be her last day at the Club! However (obviously), we did manage to reschedule. 

Anyway, so I saw her today and she said she&#8217;d spoken with the folks at the Club, and they said that she could stay on as my trainer if I were interested. So, I guess she didn&#8217;t _totally_ dump me.. 

We had a good session: worked some on the TRX with flyes, did some box jumps and sprinter lunge jumps, descending pullups, and dynamic pushups. The pushups were cool: my hands were on a &#8220;[dual grip xerball](http://www.spri.com/Item.aspx?ItemID=1466)&#8221; and then you&#8217;d push right off the ground (arms AND feet) going up. As I told Rebeccah, I have really seen results in my sports performance from working with her. I know the stability work we&#8217;ve done has come into play with derby. She was thrilled, as she said, her passion is sports performance, not how much someone can bench press. 

I also went to Mad Abs at lunch. Tonight I had derby, but for some reason my left ankle was really bugging me (as I write this now &#8211; box jumps??). I decided to go without my padded shorts, and of course managed to fall right on my tailbone before practice even started. All in all, not a great night. That&#8217;s actually why I wanted to blog today: to keep track of &#8220;off&#8221; days to try to figure out the cause. 

Yesterday I spun and ran 7 miles. My legs today felt a bit tired, but not necessarily sore. 

Since I&#8217;m writing anyway-

#### Food

  * 2 superfood slam bars
  * apple
  * brown rice, black beans, tomato and avocado in a whole wheat tortilla &#8211; it&#8217;s been a long time since I had this for lunch, yummy!
  * tea
  * homemade trail mix
  * cherries
  * banana
  * cottage cheese with cantaloupe
  * larabar
  * pb chickpea bar. These didn&#8217;t solidify as much as they have in the past :-/

I&#8217;ve had coffee (or iced chai) the past few days, and today around 2:30 I started getting grumpy and tired. But I resisted: definitely don&#8217;t need or want to fall back into old patterns!
