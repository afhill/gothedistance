Today&#8217;s race was intended to be &#8220;rehearsal&#8221; for my January marathon. I did my best to treat it as such: had my pasta last night, set out my clothing (both for the race as well as to change into afterwards), and had a quiet night. 

I arose at 5:45, because the race was in Pueblo, which is over 100 miles from where I live. However, my years of commuting made me comfortable with the long drive. Yesterday I bought some new music, so I had an enjoyable drive down to the start, hydrating well and getting myself mentally prepared. I arrived at the start in plenty of time, and was impressed with the set-up: we could wait inside where they had number pick-up and fruit and water (no coffee, sadly). It was a bit chilly, but really not too bad at all. 

<!--more-->The line-up for the portapotties was long, so the race director came by to tell us the race would start a bit late to ensure everyone was ready-the race was only $25 and they weren&#8217;t doing chip-timing. By the time we went to start a little past nine, the sun was starting to shine so I was comfortable ditching my gloves. I ran in a long-sleeved shirt, shorts and a cap. I also decided to carry my own cytomax: there were several water stops on the way, but I chose to carry the beverage to be served in January.

My training plan had said I was to start slow (:45 &#8211; 1:00 per mile slower than MP), and I tried, really I did. I caught myself going a given pace and forced myself to ease up. However, I didn&#8217;t ease back to the extent I was supposed to. The first two miles of the course had us looping around the park the course started in. We had the benefits of spectators as well as the adrenaline rush that comes from being bunched up at the start of the race.

M1: 7:53  
M2: 7:58

As we left the park, we headed down a steep hill, crossed a wooden bridge over a few fisherman, and soon enough we were off pavement and onto a trail. Hmm&#8230; although trails are easier on the legs, I hadn&#8217;t really considered the slowing effects..

M3: 7:38  
M4: 7:54

I have to admit, this was a fantastic run! We were on a trail, surrounded by some gorgeous scenery. I find I run a trail race differently: because you can generally only run two people wide, I&#8217;m always very conscious of my place and pace in relation to other runners. While I struggle on small (road) marathons, I found this race really flew along, because there was a little bit of strategy in catching up with and passing folks. 

M5: 8:00  
M6: 7:53  
M7: 7:54

While the race wasn&#8217;t easy, to some extent I felt like I was running on auto-pilot. I had a few passing thoughts (more than a third done at five, over half done at seven), but really the miles just ticked along. It was between miles 6 and 7 that we started seeing the faster runners heading back (they were passing the 9 mile marker on the way back). Although I didn&#8217;t really realize it, I think the idea of hitting the turn-around impacted my pace a bit

M8: 7:43  
M9: 7:49

The turn around was a large loop at the base of Pueblo Dam: you came off the trail into a parking lot where they had a water stop, ran a large loop and went over a bridge. THIS THING WAS BAD!! I&#8217;m ok on bridges, I&#8217;m ok on bridges when I&#8217;ve been running sub-8 min miles for over an hour. I&#8217;m NOT ok with bridges that move beneath your feet thanks to the group of runners hammering on it. I almost felt some vertigo on it, and was seriously thankful to come off it without getting sick or injured. 

Ok, melodrama over. Right around the Dam a girl had caught up and passed me. When she slowed to grab water right before getting back on the trail, I passed her. Shortly thereafter she caught up, and literally the next three miles my brain shut off as I just focused on her ahead of me (she was wearing blue tights, a blue running skirt, a white long-sleeved shirt and a pink t-shirt-it was hard NOT to focus on her).

M10: 7:54  
M11: 7:57  
M12: 7:53

Between miles 11 and 12, we got off the dirt trail onto cement. My target slowed, and I cruised by her. Almost apologetically, I thought to myself &#8220;I&#8217;m a road racer, after all&#8230;&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t want to push myself too hard, because I knew that danged hill still loomed ahead. But on the stretch of cement, I caught up and passed several folks. One woman congratulated me on a good job, and I told her I was dreading the hill! I bounded over the (stable) bridge, and there it was. Ugh! 

I started up it slowly and near the top let myself slow to a walk. I knew there was still a half mile to go and I figured I&#8217;d save some energy to finish strong. The woman I&#8217;d just passed caught up with me, and said &#8220;you did it!&#8221;. I almost felt bad as I said &#8220;thank goodness&#8221; and then turned on the jets to pass her again.

M13: 8:18  
.1: 6:56 pace  
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  
1:43:41 (7:55 pace)

They had food, water and gatorade available both inside and out, and I was pleasantly surprised they had several massage tables set up as well! While the weather had been perfect for running, it was a little chilly afterwards, and I changed into my warm, dry clothes. Despite the fact it wasn&#8217;t chip-timed, the organizers did a great job at grabbing tags and times, and had them all scrolling on a large screen inside the pavilion. I was happy with my time, although I&#8217;ll admit there was some disappointment to find I&#8217;d placed _fourth_ in my age division. Still, I stayed for the awards and cheered for everyone.

I found that people were pretty nice, and I was sorry the race was so far from home. It seemed that the majority of the award winners at least were from Colorado Springs, so it&#8217;s not as though I really could have made new running buddies. 

Our race bibs had included a coupon for a dollar off &#8220;Pueblo&#8217;s best burger and fries&#8221; at the Gold Dust Saloon, so I headed there for lunch before the long drive home. I was glad I took the time to see their historic district, but, um, Pueblo must not have much competition in the burger and fry department! 

After lunch I loaded back in the car and headed home, happy with my race and how I felt. Although I didn&#8217;t hit my goal, my pace was very consistent and I felt that it was definitely sustainable. As it is, I know that these &#8220;rehearsal&#8221; races are never really indicative of what you&#8217;re capable of come race day: the lack of tapering and the fact there&#8217;s still 6 weeks left in training have something to do with that. 

All in all, it was a great race experience! As I ran, I was thinking &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you could live in Colorado and not love to run, or do other outdoor activities.&#8221; It is SOOO beautiful here! I also realized that this is my fourth race in Colorado in the two months I&#8217;ve been here. Wow!
