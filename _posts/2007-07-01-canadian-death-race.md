Someone I worked with at The Support Network back in 2001 just asked if I&#8217;d want to do the [Canadian Death Race](http://www.canadiandeathrace.com/) as a two-person team next year. Yikes! 

 _Consider running for 125km over rough, mountain trails, through pristine forests shared with resident wildlife, over ragged, rocky, and sometimes wet or snow-covered, seemingly endless terrain. Sounds pretty tough? Well, add the fact that you are journeying over three different mountain summits and are gaining over 17,000 feet in elevation, crossing over a major river by raft, (At our spectacular Hell&#8217;s Gates canyon at the confluence of the Smoky and Sulphur Rivers.) plus running part of this race in the dark and there you have it &#8211; the makings of our larger-than-life world-class event, the Canadian Death Race!_

Registration is already closed for 2007, but I&#8217;ll admit, part of me is somewhat considering it for next year.. despite the logistical fun of being in Canada at that time, all those simple details..
