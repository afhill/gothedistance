Yes, I think I&#8217;ve fallen for Leadville! 

Race weekend was great, and when I was invited to crew this week for someone doing the 50 Miler, I agreed readily. Then last night I went to the Runners Roost Run Club, and eagerly chatted with [Amy Schneider](http://www.coloradorunnermag.com/2012/06/13/exclusive-athlete-interview-amy-schneider/) and Sean Wetstine about the weekend. They&#8217;re both running and asked if I was. Nooo&#8230;..!

Amy asked why, and said I looked really strong at the marathon. Even without my decision to focus on getting that fast fall marathon, I&#8217;m not in a place to run that type of distance. She ran the Leadville 100 last year on non-specific training, and told me she felt that it&#8217;s as much about running smart as anything else. 

I really appreciated her words and it helped affirm that I know that someday I&#8217;ll take on some of these longer distances, just not this year!

By the end of the run Sean had asked me to pace his wife Laura, who&#8217;s doing the 100 for the first time. (Originally, she was supposed to pace HIM, and then she got her own entry, so now they need two crews!) I warned them that I had the Pikes Peak Ascent the day before, but we all agreed that I&#8217;d likely still be much more fresh than Laura will be at mile 90 (or even 60). So&#8230; we&#8217;ll see! I think that would be a definite consolation for not running the Pikes Peak Marathon this year! 

I know I didn&#8217;t like the actual Leadville Marathon as much as Pikes Peak, but there is something special and exciting about the series. I&#8217;m still marveling over how Leadville is only a couple hours away, and I hope to get some more chances to get to know the special town!
