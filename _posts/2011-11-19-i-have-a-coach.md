..or, I suppose I will when I give him a check on Tuesday. 

I emailed the [Running Republic of Boulder](http://www.runningrepublic.com/) shortly after the [Rock n Roll Half](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/10/rock-and-roll-denver-half-marathon-race-report/) to inquire about joining, and coach Darren de Reuck invited me to come out to a few workouts to see if it was a fit. Today he asked if I wanted to officially join. I said yes, and the coaching started immediately! As in, he asked what races I had planned coming up. I told him I had a few marathons in January. &#8220;A few??&#8221; He asked if I could switch to the half in Disney. I said I was already registered for the half.. AND the full. But I told him I was his after that. Then I mentioned I was also registered for Leadville (just the marathon, not the 100). He asked if I had to do it&#8230; And then, as a good coach SHOULD do, he said &#8220;So do you want to get fast, or do you want to mess around? Do you want to run a three hour marathon&#8221;? I said I wanted to get fast, to which he replied &#8220;good answer&#8221;. I said &#8220;I know &#8211; I&#8217;ve run a bunch of marathons and only shaved off 9 minutes.&#8221; He said &#8220;I can tell you why&#8221; and I laughed and said &#8220;I know &#8211; the first half of that sentence is the reason why!&#8221;

So&#8230; here goes. Coaching, yikes! But I said I wanted to see what I can do, and he definitely has the expertise to take me as far as I want to go. 

In training today (warmup, 15min steady, then 6x(2.5min, 1:30 RI), 4x(:30, :60 RI)), Darren&#8217;s wife [Colleen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_De_Reuck) lead my group, and after the workout I heard her tell Darren I had some serious speed. Wow, yeah, I&#8217;m going to let that one definitely boost the ole ego. An Olympian says I have speed??? 

I&#8217;ll officially meet with Darren in January to set my goals for 2012, but in the meantime I&#8217;m part of this great new group that will help push me through these icky winter months. I&#8217;m already feeling much more confident and strong already! Is a 3 hour marathon really possible? I dunno about that &#8211; but I&#8217;d love to break 3:10. But, if I train with [a bunch of fast people](http://www.runningrepublic.com/MembersIndex.html), who knows? 

In the 4&#215;30, I was the fastest overall in the first sprint, in the second (uphill) I was in the top 3. In the next sprint on a narrow sidewalk I actually somehow kicked/stepped on a gal right in front of me (she was one of the people I blew by the first sprint &#8211; she&#8217;s a 2:59 marathoner)&#8230; I held back on the last sprint. 

At the very least I know my 3:29 from 2006 needs to fall, especially given all the improvement I&#8217;ve seen in other distances this year! I feel like 3:20 is definitely within reach and there is more improvement to be had beyond that with good training. 

Part of Today&#8217;s Workout:  
6&#215;2.5min paces: 6:22, 6:39, 6:48, 6:28, 6:28, 6:15  
4x30sec paces: 4:38, 5:02, 4:56, 5:49. I felt bad after kicking some girl on the 3rd so I held back, AND the last one was uphill
