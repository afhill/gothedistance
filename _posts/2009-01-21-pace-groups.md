After the marathon on Sunday, I mentioned to my folks that I tend to do better when I run with someone, at least for the first half. I think it helps to keep my head out of it, until it needs to be there. 

When I was speaking to my folks about it, I mentioned that the 3:20 pace group had been in my sights for the first 6 or 7 miles of the marathon, and my Dad asked if I had considered sticking with them. I laughed: if 3:23 was aggressive, 3:20 was surely out of reach!

I just received an email from a friend also asking if I&#8217;d thought about using a pace group. Just on a whim, I decided to check out the pace for a 3:20 marathon.  
&#8230;  
7:38 per mile

So that explains why I saw them for so long on Sunday: 5 of my first 8 miles were exactly that pace.

So now in a dangerous frame of mind, I&#8217;m wondering if the mental support offered by a pace group would help me with those few extra seconds, since it appears my body likes that pace anyway (at least for awhile)..
