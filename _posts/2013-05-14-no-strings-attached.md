Since returning from Panama, I&#8217;ve tried climbing a few times. I&#8217;ve been to two local places, [The Spot](http://thespotgym.com) and the [Boulder Rock Club](http://boulderrockclub.com). I&#8217;ve been amazed at how different my experiences have been, and it&#8217;s clear to me what type of climbing I prefer. 

So The Spot is bouldering: you don&#8217;t climb as high, and you don&#8217;t have ropes (and therefore don&#8217;t need a partner). I actually have gone to The Spot with my roommate Josh, which is nice because I didn&#8217;t have the insecurities about showing up someplace I&#8217;m unfamiliar with alone, but I don&#8217;t have to feel like he&#8217;s waiting on me, etc. Although initially the idea of not having ropes intimidated me, I got over that soon enough.  
We&#8217;ve gone twice on Sunday afternoons and it&#8217;s been pretty quiet, so I felt comfortable just wandering around on my own. 

My experience with the BRC was TOTALLY different, and I&#8217;m glad I had my experience with The Spot or else I may not have had any desire to continue with it. Although it&#8217;s not the club&#8217;s fault, my initial attempt to go there was when Scott (the visually impaired guy I run with) invited me to climb with him &#8211; he goes as part of a group called Adaptive Adventures. I called the group to ask what the deal was, and was basically told that if I wasn&#8217;t an experienced belayer, they didn&#8217;t need me.  
So, I signed up for a $40, 2 hour belay class at the BRC. I got there, and the class was only an hour long. I hadn&#8217;t considered the fact you climb with partners, so I was the fifth wheel in our class and it just made it a bit more tedious for people to have to sub-out of the practice.  
Also, the gym was PACKED! Granted, apparently parts were sectioned off because they were preparing to hold a competition there a few days later, but there were waits for the ropes. Obviously, that&#8217;s less of an issue when you&#8217;re climbing where there are no ropes! I did a few climbs on my own using the self-belay system, but overall I just felt like the place was too crowded.  
Although I&#8217;d taken the belay class so I could take their required &#8216;belay test&#8217; prior to climbing, they told us we couldn&#8217;t take the test right after the class. I had told Scott I&#8217;d climb with him the following Tuesday, so I came to the club 15 min early to take the test. The front desk staff tell me to get what equipment I need, and that I&#8217;d need a partner. So&#8230; I don&#8217;t HAVE a partner.. and I&#8217;m a bit anxious about belaying someone blind for my test. So I stand there looking lost and the front desk staff ignore me. I ask them where all the equipment is, since they&#8217;d helped me when I took the class. One guy gives me a harness and walks away. I continue to look lost, and ask about the test. They tell me it&#8217;s straightforward and just to go ask someone.  
In the meantime there&#8217;s tons of people wandering in, and the front meeting area is tiny and crammed. I figure I&#8217;ll just wait for Scott, but he&#8217;s late and I just get more and more frustrated.  
Finally I take my stuff off and leave. 

I get it &#8211; MOST of the climbing is with a partner so you should know how to work with a partner. But not all of it is. And maybe most people who take up rock climbing do it with a friend. But I guess I just expected if you tell people they need to demonstrate skills, you&#8217;re not going to force them to ask a stranger to do the test with?!?  
I called Scott when I left and he was nearly there, so I came in and watched him for awhile. But I was just grumpy by that time and in no mood to take this silly test.  
The fact is, if I do decide I want to come back here, I&#8217;ll obviously be coming with someone else, so I can do the test then. I wouldn&#8217;t gain anything from taking it today, as Scott had his climbing partner and I don&#8217;t have one. But there&#8217;s just so much about the place I dislike, I can&#8217;t see myself opting to come back.

In contrast, I went to The Spot just this past weekend and had a blast! Got to a point where I wasn&#8217;t afraid, and I kept going even as I tore not one, not two, but three gashes in my right hand (apparently I&#8217;m right-hand dominant when I climb). I saw it&#8217;s $8 on Fridays so I may just start going then. I just really enjoyed the fact you weren&#8217;t forced to go with a buddy, there seemed to be more options to climb and I didn&#8217;t feel like I had to work really hard to let them call me a cool kid. 

I&#8217;m not sure how my opinions about rope climbing will affect any outdoor climbing I do. Maybe it&#8217;s not the rope itself, but just the hassle that goes along with it &#8211; and if I&#8217;m going on an outdoor excursion, it wouldn&#8217;t be as big a deal. I guess we&#8217;ll see!
