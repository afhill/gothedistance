I&#8217;d planned to run this morning but I woke up with my legs pleasantly tired from last night&#8217;s practice, so I decided to lift instead.

  * [Pullups](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/pullups): 7-7-5
  * &#8220;level 6&#8221; (the gym at my apartment doesn&#8217;t list actual weights) [seated cable row](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/seated-cable-rows) 3&#215;15
  * &#8220;level 5&#8221; [narrow grip front lat pulldown](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/close-grip-front-lat-pulldown) 3&#215;15
  * &#8220;level 1&#8221; [bent over low-pulley side lateral](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/bent-over-low-pulley-side-lateral) 3&#215;10. Hard! Even one set of 10 was tiring! Interestingly enough, my left side was better with this than my right
  * 15lbs [Arnold press](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/arnold-dumbbell-press) 3&#215;15
  * 8lbs [bent over dumbbell rear delt raise with head on bench](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/bent-over-dumbbell-rear-delt-raise-with-head-on-bench). 3&#215;15. I totally admit I did this because I thought the head on bench was funny. My delts are weak-o-rama
  * 10lbs [front incline dumbbell raise](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/front-incline-dumbbell-raise) 3&#215;10
  * 20lbs [upright row](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/upright-barbell-row)3&#215;10
  * 20 bootstrappers

Food:  
6:30 mango  
7:30 scrambled egg whites with smoked salmon, rainbow chard and tomato on a pitette  
9:30 Ezekiel cereal with kefir, hemp seed and banana  
12:00pm Quinoa, light tuna, rainbow chard (can you guess what new veggie I bought at the store?), steamed carrots  
1:45 banana smeared with peanut butter in an ezekiel wrap with hemp seed, apple  
2:45 greek yogurt with strawberries and hemp seed  
5:00 leftover salad from yesterday: mixed greens, dried apricots, chickpeas, bbq tofu, avocado, jalape√±o lime citronette dressing, lentil chips  
7:30 hummus, pita, veggies

I feel like I&#8217;m eating all the time.. oh wait, I am&#8230; but increasing exercise doesn&#8217;t seem to be likely to lead to weight/muscle gain unless I&#8217;m fueling.
