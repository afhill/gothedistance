Food  
&#8211; green smoothie: spinach, banana, kiwi, orange, strawberries, hemp seed, hemp oil, hemp protein powder, wheat germ, bcaas, creatine  
&#8211; whole wheat breakfast burrito: eggs, potato, guacamole, veggie chili, salsa  
&#8211; bhakti chai/coffee blend (last one in the fridge)  
&#8211; dried apricots  
&#8211; probar superfood slam  
&#8211; chipotle bowl.. I ordered the wrong thing, ended up with cheese and white rice so ended up just eating the beans and salsa and guac. üôÅ  
&#8211; earl grey tea

The beans and salsa was a horrific mistake. I was bloated and uncomfortable from 3:30 til, well, still now at 10. Not gassy, just with huge shooting pains. At one point I got the sweats and thought I was going to throw up. Really?? 

Today was also a big fail, exercise-wise. I&#8217;d wanted to go to hot yoga but instead I was at work til 9:30. Honestly, not sure the stomach would have allowed for any exercise anyway. So, my second rest day of the week is used up! üôÅ

In other news, though, I&#8217;m soo excited for the race Sunday. An acquaintance has offered to pace me for a few miles. I think that&#8217;ll really help keep my spirits up, and most importantly help me really sense that this is a RACE.
