A day later, and I&#8217;m still on my runner&#8217;s high from the race yesterday.

Actually, this whole year has been a pretty good one, running-wise. Late last year I decided to change up my training program and do more speedwork, and it&#8217;s really changed my whole approach and rekindled my love for the sport. 

I always love a challenge, and for a time, completing 26.2 miles by foot was a pretty good one. But eventually that became less exciting, and the training itself didn&#8217;t seem worth it just to complete the distance. Moving to Colorado, I sacrificed my training group and the amount of oxygen available as I ran. I enjoyed trail running, but lost my interest in training for distance. Obviously, I also took up roller derby, which also taxed my legs, but in more quick, powerful movements. 

Changing up my program last year helped me see gains, and renewed my interest. I saw each workout as a mini-challenge, trying to hit certain paces and really focus and push myself. Racing this year has seemed easy as my official times catch up with my fitness. I can feel myself working hard, and having it pay off. Whereas marathon training is really about the long haul, I&#8217;m able to see returns more quickly, and recover and be able to move on. I feel very empowered and excited. 

I don&#8217;t know how much of it is a balance: I don&#8217;t feel the same way right now about derby. I recently &#8220;graduated&#8221; so I am on the All-Star team (and not our B-team), but I find I&#8217;m actually a bit insecure about it. I feel I have to live up to expectations of the team, and I put pressure on myself that I don&#8217;t with running. Of course, there&#8217;s something there that attracted me to the sport, away from my life as the solitary runner, but there is a whole different dynamic. Obviously, I&#8217;m a strong personality with incredible willpower, but there is a part of me that distances myself if I feel expectations are placed upon me by others, rather than by myself. Not even expectations&#8230; if I feel I am doing something for someone, regardless of what they expect. In running, if I decide I want to run a race, I sign up and I run&#8230; or I don&#8217;t. With derby, with every game someone needs to bequeath upon me the privilege of suiting up. It ceases to be about my capabilities and my confidence, and becomes how those are perceived by someone else. It becomes heady, which we all know I don&#8217;t need. 

For right now, running just seems easy and exciting again. For the first time in a long time, I have a whole series of races lined up:

  * June 25th: [Slacker Half Marathon](http://www.slackerhalfmarathon.com/)
  * July 1: [Canada Day 15K](https://www.events.runningroom.com/applications/?raceId=6395&eventId=20454&vrindex=3)
  * July 22/23: [Epic Rocky Mountain Relay](http://www.epicrelays.com)
  * Aug 20/21: [Pikes Peak Double](http://www.pikespeakmarathon.org)
  * Jan 15: [Houston Half Marathon](http://www.chevronhoustonmarathon.com/)

I&#8217;m also debating on a fall event, although I know training for the next few months is going to be rough. But for the first time in awhile, I feel it&#8217;s manageable and I&#8217;m excited to make it work!
