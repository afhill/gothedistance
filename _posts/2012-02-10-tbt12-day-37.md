#### Exercise

&#8211; Lots of back work &#8211; tons of rows!  
&#8211; My shoulders are really tight at the top, so I did this lat pulldown with really light weight and just worked the very top. Basically I started with my hands right above my head together and pulled down to just separate my hands.  
&#8211; I also did 30x45lbs on the incline bench. I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m going to do 30 quick reps (or more??) every time I go in, just once, to add to that endurance. I&#8217;ll up the weight next time.  
&#8211; 4.25mile run.
