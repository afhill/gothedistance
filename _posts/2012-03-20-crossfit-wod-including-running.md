I was excited when I saw today&#8217;s workout: 

>   * Run 800m then do as many Air Squats as possible in the time it took you to run
>   * Run 400m then do as many Push Press as possible in the time it took you to run 
>   * Run 800m then do as many Pull Ups as possible in the time it took you to run
>   * Run 400m then do as many Tire Flips as possible in the time it took you to run

You kept track of reps and then got one second off for every rep. Sound familiar?? 

The course was just around the building next to us, I&#8217;m fairly confident it wasn&#8217;t 400m around, but oh well. The recommended weight for the push press was 45# for gals, 65# for guys. I went with that weight. 

I&#8217;m not great at keeping track of time, so I used my phone to get my splits right. 

First run (800m): 2:59  
Air squats: 99

Second run (400m): 1:32  
Push press: 26

Third run (800m): 3:08  
Pull-ups (with band&#8230;ugh!): 26. I actually gave up early on this to be ready for my last run&#8230;

Fourth run (400m): 1:27  
Tire flip: 15

Total time: 18:41  
Total reps: 166 (so subtract 2:46)  
Final adjusted time: 15:55

This was definitely a fun one! After the air squats my legs were a bit rubbery, but the other activities were fine. I still REALLY need to figure out this pull-up thing!
