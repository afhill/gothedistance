Obviously, I love working out. It&#8217;s tough to balance all the different interests I have without overdoing it or letting some parts suffer. 

This morning I ran an easy 3.5 miles. It was slow but it was a great head-clearing run.  
At lunch I did a 30 min abs class and a 30 min Bootcamp-style class (deck squats, bosu burpees, woodchoppers, etc).  
Then tonight I missed scrimmage but attended the last hour of MHC practice. My legs already feel dramatic improvement over yesterday!

I weighed myself after my classes at the gum, I&#8217;m back down to 114. Whoops! Time to get my eat on- I had two mixed shakes (amazing meal and vega whole food optimizer) so hopefully I&#8217;m fueling appropriately.
