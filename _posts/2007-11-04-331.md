I took a week off after Columbus, and last week started back up again running. I feel pretty good! Ran 6.25 on Monday, 5 on Wednesday, and met the gang for just shy of 10 on Saturday. We actually went at an 8:16 clip, not too bad! Rich and Jen are training for Tallahassee, so that&#8217;ll be good to ensure they&#8217;re doing decent miles. Hard to believe Vegas is in a month!

Andy is running Huntington today, hope it goes well for him! He was bitten by the bug again, ran 3:21 in Columbus and decided to try for 3:10 at this one. Hope it works out ðŸ™‚
