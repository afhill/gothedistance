7am, and I&#8217;ve put in my 6 miles for the day!

Yesterday I tried the treadmill after work.. I just can&#8217;t do it. I think I lasted a mile and a half (I had planned a mile warmup, 4 mile tempo run, a mile cooldown). I did get to wear my bite sandals though, they were pretty nice. It actually made it fun, b/c it did sort of feel like I was barefoot.. except a bit more cushiony.

Anyway, back to today. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve never thought about the fact that High St is lit up 24/7, so when I got up today I decided to head on down to Arcadia. I love running when it&#8217;s dark and crisp.. I think I may have to really get into the habit of doing this daily (either before or after work)
