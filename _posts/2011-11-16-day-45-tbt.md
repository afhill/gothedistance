I fell off the wagon there for a bit &#8211; things have been stressful and I also succumbed to some social pressure (inflicted on myself) to drink over the weekend. But I&#8217;m back &#8211; although I have three trips over the next three weeks that may make things a bit difficult.

Food  
&#8211; scrambled eggs, spinach, tomato, hemp seed, chia seed in a whole wheat tortilla  
&#8211; butternut squash soup, whole wheat bread (note: it occured to me after I ate it that this probably had a ton of cream in it)  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; dried apricots  
&#8211; pistachios  
&#8211; lobster Cobb salad, no cheese (how to tell you&#8217;re on the east coast! This was in some random diner)

Exercise  
&#8211; easy 4.25 mile run
