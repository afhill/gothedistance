#### Food

&#8211; Ezekiel cereal with kefir, hemp seed, blueberries  
&#8211; 2 bananas  
&#8211; egg, potato, veggie chili, mango salsa, guacamole, veggies in a whole wheat tortilla  
&#8211; apple  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; wild woods sprouted tofu burger, curried cauliflower and squash, quinoa (leftovers from yesterday)  
&#8211; cashews  
&#8211; veggie juice: cucumber, apple, cilantro  
&#8211; weird gluten-free taco pasta pre-packaged thing. Ingredients: brown rice pasta, shelled hemp seed, salt, tomato powder, paprika, onion, garlic, oregano, ground red pepper and silicon dioxide. I added onion, tomato, cilantro, olive oil/citrus habanero olive oil, and quorn chikn bits. Not bad, though stuff really does taste different out of a package.  
&#8211; frozen banana &#8220;ice cream&#8221; (just blended frozen bananas, a bit of coconut milk and cacao nibs)

#### Exercise</h3> 

&#8211; Mad abs class. We did a lot of planks, which were actually a challenge. Guess what I haven&#8217;t done much of lately??  
&#8211; Power 30 class: kettlebell swings, band rows, band shoulder presses, and some throws and pulls with [these](http://wwww.viprfit.com)  
&#8211; Spinning class. And I didn&#8217;t hate it!
