Today I returned to my ole tenth-of-a-mile indoor track at the Rec center for my workout. How&#8217;d it go?

Workout: 1 mile warmup, 5x(1k @ 3:52, 400m RI), 1 mile cooldown.

I did my math to determine that each kilometer would be 6.25 laps on the track, and I should average 37 seconds a lap. 

  1. 32, 35, 36, 36, 36, 36, 9 = 220 = 3:40
  2. 35, 37, 37, 37, 38, 37, 8 = 229 = 3:49
  3. 35, 38, 37, 38, 38, 35, 8 = 229 = 3:49
  4. 36, 38, 38, 39, 37, 37, 9 = 234 = 3:54 (I believe this was the one where random kids were running on the track and I had to dodge them)
  5. 37, 38, 37, 38, 38, 36, 9 = 233 = 3:53</ul> 

6.1 miles in 51:26. Average heart rate 159, max heart rate 189.

Overall, I hit the paces all right: my overall pace for the intervals was 3:49 (which is a 6:08 pace). There were more folks walking and running on the track near the end, which meant I was dodging and weaving a bit. I feel pretty confident I could have hit all the paces otherwise. 

I&#8217;m glad to have these workouts to aim for. Although they can seem a bit daunting, I feel an incredible sense of accomplishment at the end!
