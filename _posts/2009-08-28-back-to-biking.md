There was a slight&#8230; mishap with my work visa this week that lead me to be without a valid driver&#8217;s license at the moment. Thankfully, my apartment is close to work, so it didn&#8217;t take too much to decide that I&#8217;ll be using two-wheeled transportation for awhile!

Yesterday was my first day, and I managed to miss the one tricky turn on the route. Still, I didn&#8217;t get too off-track, and made it into work in what I felt was a reasonable 33 minutes (distance: 6.43 miles). Another coworker actually had her bike as well, so we rode to grab lunch together. As September draws nearer, it was great to have an excuse to be outside enjoying the gorgeous weather. We also stopped by a Farmer&#8217;s market after work before I headed home. 

Today I figured out the correct turn, and the route came out at 5.95 miles. It&#8217;s definitely uphill on the way to work, but that just makes it easier to leave the office at the end of the day:

To work:  
5.95 miles in 27:18. Avg speed was 13.1mph, max speed was 23.1mph. 318 ft descent, 567 ft ascent

From work:  
5.97 miles in 21:25. Avg speed was 16.7mph, max speed was 28.8mph. 489 ft descent, 234 ft ascent.

So all in all in the past two days I&#8217;ve biked more than I have all summer! Surprisingly the knee seems ok with this added activity, which is great. I actually like fresh air on the way home, a way to clear my head.
