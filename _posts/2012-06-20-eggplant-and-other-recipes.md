It&#8217;s been awhile since I posted any recipes on here &#8211; I&#8217;ve actually been making the mango tofu curry for months and just hadn&#8217;t posted it. 

[Mango tofu curry](http://www.spelonca.com/2011/08/19/light-and-breezy-mango-tofu-curry-in-lettuce-bowl/) &#8211; I skip the lettuce bowl and just eat it with brown rice. Nice blend of sweet and tangy. 

[Baba Ghanouj](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/eggplant_dip_baba_ghanouj/) &#8211; Oddly enough, I&#8217;m not a huge baba ghanoush fan when I go out, but I had an eggplant and some time on my hands. This recipe actually turned out better than I may have expected. I threw in a fair bit of turmeric as well to give it a nice smoky flavor. I blended it til smooth despite the recipe recommendation and it has a really nice complex flavor. 

<a href=http://www.choosingraw.com/omega-rich-broccoli-hemp-slaw-with-tangy-mustard-dressing/">Omega Rich Broccoli Hemp Slaw with Tangy Mustard Dressing</a> &#8211; What can I say, I love the Choosing Raw website. She has so many simple delicious recipes! I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve shared it here yet, so I&#8217;ll also just mention her&#8230;

[Eggplant and Arugula Wraps with Tomato Basil Cashew Cheese](http://www.choosingraw.com/eggplant-and-arugula-wraps-with-tomato-basil-cashew-cheese/). I&#8217;ve modified this a few times as well, mostly because I&#8217;ve never made cashew cheese.. but the combination of the rest of the ingredients is really tasty. Yes, I&#8217;ve definitely been experimenting with eggplant!
