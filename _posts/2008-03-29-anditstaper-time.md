that&#8217;s right, another peak of training over and done with!

Yesterday I was feeling a bit better. I had been thinking about a mile or two. A friend who&#8217;s training for [her first half](http://capitalcityhalfmarathon.com/) had two miles to do, so we decided to go together. I ran to her house (a half mile) and we headed out. At the end of the run I ran the extra half mile home.. only to realize my keys were sitting on her counter. So my &#8220;mile or two&#8221; became 4. My left knee was a bit sore. It used to get sore sometimes, generally if I took some time off. Since the beginning of the year, it&#8217;s really never been sore like this before. I was a bit apprehensive about it, but it quickly faded.

I knew I had 20 to do today, but I was a bit concerned about my ability to keep up with the gang. I woke up completely congested with lips parched from dehydration, and wasn&#8217;t sure running was the best thing for me right then. At the same time, I know that today is the day, the start of the taper. I knew that after this weekend, the hard work was done, and my biggest tasks related to the marathon were to get healthy and mentally prepare. I knew that those little aches and pains would disappear, and that they were just a sign of hard work and preparation. I knew that I had a run to get done, and it would be so.

This winter, I&#8217;ve managed to uncover two significant benefits to treadmill running. One is the fact that I can turn on my iPod and &#8220;zone out&#8221;. I learned a few weeks ago that evidently I can&#8217;t manage to listen to my iPod while not running on a stationary object.. so if I want to run without thinking about running, the &#8220;Dreadmill&#8221; is the way to go. The other big benefit came into play today. I&#8217;ve been congested and thirsty, and running on the treadmill meant immediate access to beverages and/or kleenex. 

I headed to the gym at around 10:30 or so. Started off slowly (~9:40) and as time went on, picked up the pace little by little. My garmin gave me some error about inaccurate lap lengths, perhaps since I was indoors, so I don&#8217;t have the exact time by seconds. I do know that after having to stop and restart my time on the treadmill several times (you&#8217;re limited to 60 minutes), I finished my 20 miles in 3:00:xx (9:00 overall pace). 

So it&#8217;s done, I&#8217;m ready. I will do 10 tomorrow, but it will be at a reasonable pace. And then the next few weeks will be gravy, and then I&#8217;ll get to toe the line at a race that is but a dream for so many out there, knowing that I&#8217;ve prepared as best I can. 

Sooooo excited!
