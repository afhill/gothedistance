Wednesday afternoon my throat started to hurt. My &#8220;between 6 and 8 mile&#8221; run became 6, and I was hurtin through part of it, stopping to walk against the wind, and my throat was aching. That night I didn&#8217; sleep more than an hour at a time. Thursday I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to eat: I drank tea, water, a peach slushee and had 3 cookies. This morning I was so weak I had to lay down twice while making myself breakfast, and at one point I broke out in a cold sweat &#8211; literally, I could see the moisture on my skin.

Just got back from the doctor, and I have strep throat. So no half-marathon for me tomorrow (I&#8217;m not that upset about it) but I&#8217;m a bit concerned about how this is going to affect the rest of my training. I guess it is better than the flu, as I have antibiotics and all, but still.

Well, better now than in 2 weeks!!
