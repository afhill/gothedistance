Today&#8217;s rev running workout was a 20 min warmup, 6x :30s fast, :30 recovery, 20 min cooldown. I didn&#8217;t check my watch during the intervals, and was pretty happy with what I saw when I finished:

1: 6:06 (avgHR: 165, maxHR: 179)  
2: 5:55 (avgHR: 179, maxHR: 181)  
3: 5:39 (avgHR: 173, maxHR: 181)  
4: 5:18 (avgHR: 180, maxHR: 185)  
5: 5:31 (avgHR: 180, maxHR: 184)  
6: 5:21 (avgHR: 182, maxHR: 186)

Overall we covered 5.75 in 50:03, at an average pace of 8:43, avgHR: 164.

I didn&#8217;t think I could still run in the mid 5s! Granted, it was for really short periods of time, but it was exciting to see the ole legs can still turn over! 

Also &#8211; thanks timehop!
