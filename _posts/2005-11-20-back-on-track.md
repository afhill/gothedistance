Ran 6.5 this morning at Goodale, and it was so gorgeous out I couldn&#8217;t pass up Highbanks this afternoon. Took the first lap at a reasonable pace, until with a half mile to go I heard some guys coming up behind me. I decided that I wasn&#8217;t going to let them pass me, so I picked it up. I held them off, although they were pretty close there at the end. As the passed me after I&#8217;d stopped, one of them said &#8220;nice finish!&#8221; .. and then they kept running. So darnit, they weren&#8217;t even probably trying to catch me! ðŸ™‚ Ah well, I grabbed a sip of water and continued on myself. It was already past 5 at this time so I knew I didn&#8217;t have time for two whole loops, so I went for one more round at the top loop (the one we call three miles, which is really closer to 2.5). I was still recovering from my fast finish, so it took me 13 min to the overlook, and then I decided to pick it up a bit on the way back. Despite the fact that the way back is actually a bit longer (we go a bit further before turning), I finished the entire top loop in just shy of 24. Phew!

So today&#8217;s grand total:  
56 min this morning  
1:17 this afternoon.

I&#8217;m calling it about 15.5 miles (probably generous). I&#8217;m content with that.
