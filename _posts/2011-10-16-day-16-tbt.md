Exercise  
&#8211; none! 

In lieu of physical exertion today, I had an amazing 1.5hr deep tissue/deep heat therapy massage. Some of it was pretty painful at the time, but it helped so much! I&#8217;m enjoying my kettlebell workouts, but my hamstrings are definitely impacted and I felt relief right after the massage. Then once I got home I spend most of the day in the kitchen, listening to a ton of [Endurance Planet](http://www.enduranceplanet.com) podcasts and cooking away. I made a lentil spread, peanut butter chickpea bars, sweet potato cornbread, as well as my meals (spaghetti squash, and sweet potato burritos). I&#8217;m not much of a chef, but sometimes it&#8217;s fun to just throw things together. 

Food  
&#8211; quinoa, hemp milk, chia seed, hem seed, blueberries  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; apple  
&#8211; quorn chikn nuggets  
&#8211; greek yogurt and honey  
&#8211; spaghetti squash, whole grain tempeh, raw red and yellow peppers  
&#8211; sweet potato and black bean burritos (whole grain tortilla)  
&#8211; sweet potato cornbread w/ earth balance. I haven&#8217;t had butter or marg in so long, I think I enjoyed the spread as much as the bread!
