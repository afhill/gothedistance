I may possibly run 13 or 16 miles tomorrow.

It&#8217;s a highbanks day, which generally means 6/9/12. However, I said I&#8217;d run the [Frozen Nose 4Miler](http://consumer.discoverohio.com/searchdetails.aspx?detail=47430). It&#8217;s out in Marysville, which is closer to Highbanks than home. So my thinking is.. Highbanks as a &#8220;warm-up&#8221;, then off to Marysville to register. The race is at noon, so I can afford to leave Highbanks as late as 11ish to get there. Heck, that means I could conceivably put in 12 miles before heading off to the &#8216;race&#8217;&#8230;

The [resolution](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pgx4qM2eRki4TlC-_e4XeJA) is going well. Twice this week I felt sluggish and grumpy and told myself &#8220;I only need to do one little mile&#8221; and once I got out the door, I felt great!

I just got back from the gym, which is .1mile away from work, and 2.5miles from home. Renting a locker is $15/month.. I could drop work clothes off there, then run to work, shower and change, then run home. I&#8217;m thinking about it&#8230;
