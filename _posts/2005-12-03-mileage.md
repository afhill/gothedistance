We were talking about monthlies today at Highbanks (I did 9 of my target 20 miles today&#8230;). I ran 74.25 miles in November.. my lowest of the year, obviously. Ah well, ya need that every once in awhile. I have 1429.36 for the year, so I&#8217;ll definitely clear 1500 miles in 2005.

I was telling everyone today, no more winter marathons for me! I&#8217;m just not into training right now. The past week has been ok, but my motivation to do long runs is really waining. Hopefully taking a couple weeks off after Disney before Boston training will help me get my head back in the game..
