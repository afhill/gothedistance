Monday: 6.75 around the neighbourhood at an 8:34 pace. Felt pretty good considering the high mileage weekend! Legs felt a little slow around mile 4 but definitely not over-worked. 

Tuesday: I traveled Monday night and was too tired to run before work (silly time zone difference). I considered taking a day off running but the cool evening air called to me. Did an easy 4 after dinner (my stomach wasn&#8217;t too happy) at a 9:25 pace. It was funny to see my Garmin starting stats: elevation: 15. heart rate: 57. I went to the gym after and mostly worked abs.

Wednesday: Enjoyed the crisp morning with a nice 8 miles at an 8:11 pace. I also realized I was very close to a milestone..

Thursday: Essentially a rest day. Did some light stuff at the gym but nothing significant.

Friday: Felt super to be back in Colorado and running in shorts and a t-shirt. Pulled off 6.3 miles at a 7:59 pace, completing more than 200 miles this month, for my highest ever!

Saturday: Rough one: we had a tempo run scheduled, 6 miles at (progressive) race pace. I only made it through 5, not entirely progressive (6:58, 6:59, 6:59, 6:49, 7:01). I had to cut it short because of time constraints, but also my legs were not feeling great. Later I felt headachy and dehydrated: this 80* weather may be a bit much for me! I also suspect I should have run easier on Friday. In all, did 8.25 in 1:02. I decided that this week I wouldn&#8217;t make the 50mpw I&#8217;ve been averaging. And that&#8217;s ok!

Sunday: Met KJ for 12; that&#8217;s what she had on her schedule and I decided I&#8217;d be happy as long as I got in 45 miles for the week. When I met with my coach in January, he&#8217;d said he thought I should be around 45-50mpw. I&#8217;ve been consistently exceeding that, but given how rough I was feeling yesterday, I decided it was best to ease up a bit. As it was, I slept a solid 8 hours last night and felt pretty strong today! We ended up doing 12.88 at an 8:26 pace. 

Weekly total: 46.18

I didn&#8217;t get in much lifting and no crossfit this week. I also had my first week of trying to avoid eggs, dairy and gluten. I did pretty well until a party last night where I decided not to worry. I had brownies, cookies AND beer.. and my stomach immediately let me know it wasn&#8217;t happy. It&#8217;s crazy how I was so used to having an upset stomach after eating, I just accepted it. And now for the past week I&#8217;ve felt SO much better! I won&#8217;t forget.. sure, in some cases I&#8217;ll make an exception if it&#8217;s worth it, but I definitely would like to avoid this discomfort as much as I can!  
The one really interesting thing I noted: my weight has stayed consistent but my scale registered the lowest body fat percentage I&#8217;ve ever seen on it &#8211; by about 2%! Crazy! 

It seems not only has Spring sprung here in Colorado, we&#8217;ve gone straight to Summer. It&#8217;s been in the 80s all week. Great for lazing around, but I&#8217;m finding I&#8217;m really struggling to stay hydrated. My water bottle doesn&#8217;t leave my side!
