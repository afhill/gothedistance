Two days of waking up early and my body clock is set, I woke on my own at 6:20 this morning. 

I usually run long on Sundays but I want to rest in anticipation for next week. Still, the race was on my mind for most of the day. 

#### Food

  * First, I got to try one of the [peanut butter protein bars](http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=1504166) I made last night. In honor of some of the discussions we&#8217;ve been having on sweeteners, I left out the maple syrup and just added more peanut butter. They were a bit crumbly but really not bad!
  * leftover smoothie from yesterday. I added almond milk as it had thickened up overnight
  * fresh squeezed OJ
  * kodiak cakes (thanks for the reminder about these, Frida!) with earth balance and fresh blackberries. Although looking at the ingredients, I don&#8217;t think I should consider earth balance &#8220;clean&#8221;.
  * sweet potato hash. My second attempt. Still needs work.
  * decaf nf Starbucks latte
  * clif bar
  * vegan pho
  * guacamole with multi-seed crackers
  * another peanut butter protein bar
  * vega whole foods optimizer with almond milk
  * [raw beet and carrot nori rolls](http://www.choosingraw.com/raw-beet-and-vegetable-stuffed-nori-rolls/) &#8211; another great recipe from choosingraw.com. I didn&#8217;t have any cucumbers or avocado to put in the roll, so I ended up some randomness: bean sprouts, hard-boiled egg and basil. But they were pretty tasty! 
  * greek yogurt with blackberries

I&#8217;ve been thinking more about all the fruit I eat lately. On a recent Ben Greenfield Fitness podcast, he mentioned that he thinks that people wanting to lose weight shouldn&#8217;t have more than 2 servings of fruit a day. I&#8217;m not trying to lose weight, but it definitely caused me to think a bit about how much fruit I consume. I&#8217;m going to try to make the effort to eat more veggies and less fruit and see how I feel. 

#### Exercise

Officially, rest day. Unofficially:

  * hanging knee lifts (1 set of 10, 1 set of 8 )
  * some light glute work
  * I also decided today was the day to start the [hundred pushup challenge](http://hundredpushups.com/week3.html). I started on week 3, the 3rd column. My sets were 14, 18, 14, 14, 20.
