Today&#8217;s workout was a &#8220;choice&#8221; &#8211; hills or fartlek. I went with the fartlek workout, 

15-30 min warmup  
5x (5min fast, 3min recovery)  
15-30 min cooldown.

I set my garmin, and headed towards the Highline Canal Trail. It was the first really chilly morning, so I was bundled up in pants, a long sleeved shirt, a fleece, a hat and gloves. Before I started the first fast bit, however, I took off the fleece, and kept taking off and putting on my gloves. There was a bit of a wind, that made for a challenging run in some parts.

warmup: 9:14mm  
speed1: 6:53mm  
speed2: 7:09mm &#8211; I was already pooped after this, so my &#8220;recovery jog&#8221; became a walk  
speed3: 6:59mm  
speed4: 7:23mm &#8211; wind was brutal here. actually stopped my watch for a bit, then restarted  
speed5: 7:08mm  
cooldown: 8:57mm

I didn&#8217;t feel great during the fast sections, 5 minutes is a long time to be cruising. I tried to aim for roughly 5K pace (7:04) but after the first section, I wasn&#8217;t pushing myself as much as I could have been. 

My leg started hurting during the last speed section, so I took it easier on the way back than I may have hoped (my distance was 7.91, an even 8 would have made me happy). The tongue of my shoe kept slipping, which caused me to start tensing my foot and holding it differently. I know that&#8217;s the main problem, so I&#8217;ll really have to look at how to remedy that.

As well, last night I bought [CytoMax](http://www.cytosport.com/Product.aspx?ProductID=5), which is what they serve at the Rock and Roll races. I didn&#8217;t bring any with me, but I had some after the run. It&#8217;s not horrible, it just tastes like powdered orange drink &#8211; less like sports beverage. I&#8217;ll keep trying it so that I get used to the flavor come game day!
