It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve been to the gym. Running and crossfit have taken up a lot of my workout time, but sometimes it&#8217;s just good to focus on lifting. My two goals: work on my bench press and do some good ab work.

Although some revile crossfit for focusing on power rather than form, and not being great for building nice big muscle, I was happy to be able to incorporate a few things from crossfit today. 

The first was a workout we did a few weeks ago: 10-1 medicine ball v-ups and push/pullups. At crossfit I did pullups but today I just went with pushups. 

1 V-up, 9 pushups  
2 V-ups, 8 pushups  
3 V-ups, 7 pushups  
4 V-ups, 6 pushups  
5 V-ups, 5 pushups  
6 V-ups, 4 pushups  
7 V-ups, 3 pushups  
8 V-ups, 2 pushups  
9 V-ups, 1 pushup. 

Since I&#8217;m pretty good at pushups, this wasn&#8217;t as difficult as when we did in crossfit, plus I didn&#8217;t push the intensity as much then. Still a good way to tire out my abs! (Also, I think it was good to increase the V-ups, rather than the other way around).

Then when I went to work on my bench press, I used the 5-4-3-2-1 approach we did the other day working on our press. The idea is to start at around 60% of your 1RM and add 10% as you decrease in reps. I modified a bit, but the premise was the same:

55lbs &#8211; 5  
64lbs &#8211; 4  
85lbs &#8211; 3 (this was a mistake to go up this much, but then I decided to try to stick with it)  
95lbs &#8211; 1  
105lbs &#8211; failure x 2  
95lbs &#8211; 1  
100lbs &#8211; failure

Then I went down to 70lbs and did 10-10-10-7. For the Flying Pig Pump and Run next May, I&#8217;ll be targeting [50x70lbs](http://www.pumpandrunrace.com/Lift%20Chart%20FEMALE%20FULL%20and%20HALF%20LATEST%20021009.pdf). 

I then did a lot of core work: weighted side bends, leg lifts on a decline, etc etc. I worked through nearly to fatigue (starting with the V-ups helped me get there). 

I then worked a bit on my left leg strength with single-leg squats and such. It&#8217;s frustrating that it&#8217;s visibly smaller than the right. I need to stop relying on my right side so much!
