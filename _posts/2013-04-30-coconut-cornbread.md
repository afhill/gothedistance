Tonight I decided to try making cornbread again. A few months ago I tried a recipe from Supermarket Vegan that was a [Black-Bean and Coconut-Cornbread Bake](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2013/02/jamaican-style-black-bean-and-coconut-cornbread-bake/ "Jamaican-style Black Bean and Coconut-Cornbread Bake"), which ended up being a little lacking. Tonight I skipped the fancy black bean and tomatoes and tried to just modify the recipe to make coconut cornbread.

The first modification I had to make was to replace the all-purpose flour with something gluten-free. I had some coconut flour; perfect! However, the coconut flour advises that you need to add egg when using it to replace flour. So I had to replace _that_ with Ener-G egg replacer. 

1cup coconut flour  
1cup yellow cornmeal  
1.25 tsp baking powder (and whoops.. I just realized I&#8217;d have doubled the flour and cornmeal, and didn&#8217;t double this&#8230;)  
Ener-g egg replacer and water  
1 can coconut milk  
however much frozen corn I had left in the freezer  
2 tbsp coconut oil (again, this should have probably been doubled)  
agave nectar

And since it&#8217;s coconut cornbread, I threw in some grated coconut for good measure!

Everything went in an 8&#215;8&#8243; baking dish, and was baked for 30 min at 350. Pretty easy!

And&#8230; apparently I still have some refinements to do on my cornbread. It ended up pretty crumbly and doesn&#8217;t have a nice brownish topping. Part of me can&#8217;t help but think that I may never be able to make the vegan, gluten-free cornbread of my dreams, but I may keep trying&#8230;
