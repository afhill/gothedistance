I often forget we each have our own goals and motivation for running. And perhaps more importantly, different ways to work towards those goals.

Lisa and I each ran the Cap City Half last year; she kicked my butt. She&#8217;d run a few marathons too, and done pretty well. She and I both talked about trying to qualify for Boston, but she ended up getting hurt at the CBus marathon. Then she ran another marathon not too much later, got hurt again.

As far as I can see, she&#8217;s a decent runner, but she doesn&#8217;t give herself alot of time off. I invited her to run with our group because I thought it might offer her some discipline, as well as a chance to learn from some more experienced runners. A month or so back she told me that she wasn&#8217;t going to race anymore til Cap City, b/c the 16 mile training run she did left her sore for weeks. She also stopped seeming interested to run with us. Ah well.

Then out of the blue, she emails me today to tell me she&#8217;s running the full marathon on Sunday! I&#8217;m in shock.. I actually told her I was going to kick her butt. Literally. I don&#8217;t see how she can possibly have trained for this, since two weeks ago when we were doing the 15 miler, she was running 10 miles.. unless she was already tapering?

Now, I guess I shouldn&#8217;t question if she&#8217;s ready. This will be her third marathon in 4 months (although she DNF CBus), she must have a sense as to her overall fitness. She said she&#8217;s not planning on racing it, just doing it to expend some energy. All the power to her, I guess. And perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t even care.

Yet I hear her talk about wanting to BQ. After she ran Palm Beach, she sent me an email telling me how proud I should be for qualifying since she just can&#8217;t seem to do it. But I just feel like the answer is staring her in the face. She needs to be healthy. I think she knows it herself.. and that&#8217;s why she told me she was not going to race for awhile. I just wonder if in the back of her head she thinks if she runs enough marathons, qualifying will &#8216;just happen&#8217;. Call me cynical, I think it&#8217;s more likely she&#8217;s wearing herself out and could be seriously injured. But here is a girl who had her PhD by 27 &#8211; I think she gets her mind set on something and goes full-steam ahead.

It&#8217;s just so frustrating.. she looks to me for alot of advice and such, I just wish she could take this bit. I know she could do it! But I guess her goals and how she wants to move towards them are different than my own&#8230;
