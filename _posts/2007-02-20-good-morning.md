I just love getting my workout in first thing in the morning. I wasn&#8217;t sure I&#8217;d be able to get up this morning, but I actually woke up before my alarm, shortly before 5. Didn&#8217;t get up til about 10 after, then headed to the gym. Did a few leg exercices and a tiny bit of abs, then got on the treadmill. I was listening to &#8220;[The Happiness Hypothesis](http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_GDAN_000062&BV_UseBVCookie=Yes)&#8220;, which isn&#8217;t exactly high energy, but it kept my mind occupied. I did 1 mile warmup, then 5 x 3:00 @ 6% grade, 2min between, all at a 10 min mile, for 4 miles total. I like doing inclines, I feel like it&#8217;s pushing myself but my legs don&#8217;t get beaten up like &#8216;traditional&#8217; speedwork. Also, I measured the drive, and it&#8217;s exactly two miles to the gym from my house, so I may have to run there on ocassion!
