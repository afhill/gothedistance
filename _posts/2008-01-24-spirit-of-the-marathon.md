Tonight was the premiere of [Spirit of the Marathon](http://www.marathonmovie.com), in theatres across the country. I&#8217;d been waiting for the movie for awhile and was excited to see it. 

I knew a bit about it; it would follow a number of people, from first-timers to world-class athletes, as they prepared for the Chicago marathon. 

It was fun to watch a runners&#8217; movie in a big theater full of runners. We laughed together when one first-timer recounted the story of people asking her if she thought she&#8217;d win. Many of us twittered at the notion that the elites run an entire marathon at a faster pace than was possible to achieve on a treadmill owned by one of the trainees. (the treadmill goes 12mph, or 5min miles&#8230;).

I shed more than a few tears, and felt apprehension and excitement thinking about Boston training, which starts this upcoming Monday. There were so many different people in the movie, with such disparate backgrounds and goals, but the marathon is special for all of them. 

I can&#8217;t wait to run another&#8230;!!
