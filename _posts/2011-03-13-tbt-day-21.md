Wow&#8230; Worst sleep I&#8217;ve had in months last night. I tossed and turned, was super thirsty and didn&#8217;t feel refreshed when I woke up. I&#8217;m blaming the crapola I ate yesterday and the work my body had to do to process it all. My whole day was rough, and while I can&#8217;t blame my nutrition for the circumstances, I do think that my emotions were up and down, and that could definitely be food-related. I was also craving starbucks today, which is unusual. Funny how quickly the body gets hooked on stimulants.

#### Food:

  * 8:00 Ezekiel cereal, kefir, hemp seed, chia seed, cantaloupe
  * 11:00 protein pancakes with peanut butter
  * 11:45 quinoa with asparagus
  * 1:30 pear, orange, kiwi
  * 2:00 miracle reds bar
  * 3:00 banana, almonds
  * 3:30 salad with shrimp
  * 6:30 tofu veggie bowl &#8211; I&#8217;d planned to cook, then realized I&#8217;d already packed all my pots and pans (oh &#8211; I&#8217;m moving tomorrow)
  * 9:00 orange
  * 10:00 apple with pb

#### Exercise:

  * 13min of intervals on my bike until my neighbors called in a noise complaint. At 2:30pm on a Sunday? Really? Glad I&#8217;m moving.. _and this is what I mean about my emotions being up and down, I REALLY let this bug me_
  * Front dumbbell raise 15lbs 3&#215;10
  * External rotation 15lbs 3&#215;15
  * Dumbbell raise (row) (30lbs-4 3) (25lbs-5 5)
  * Seated dumbbell press on ball (20lbs 10 8 7)<?li> 
    
      * Elbow out lift thing (20lbs 15 12 10)
      * Power partials (10lbs 15 12 10)</ul> 
    I woke up with my back feeling comfortably worked out this morning. Perfect!
