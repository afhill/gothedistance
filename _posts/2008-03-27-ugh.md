looking at my last post is interesting: I said &#8220;all is well&#8221; but since then things have definitely gone downhill. I actually woke up Tuesday in the middle of the night with an audible &#8220;ow!&#8221; because I thought I was being poked in the ear. I&#8217;ve had that annoying ear-flittering on and off since then (which I associate with sinus troubles). I&#8217;ve been very tired and yesterday I actually left work with a headache and slept for several hours in the afternoon, and STILL had trouble getting up this morning (I actually called in sick today).

So needless to say, the running is taking a hit. I went out last night for an easy mile and actually felt better while running than I had all day, but I know that I don&#8217;t need to be zapping my energy level at all. I hope that I&#8217;ll be feeling better by Saturday, when we have our first and only 20 miler in preparation for Boston coming up!
