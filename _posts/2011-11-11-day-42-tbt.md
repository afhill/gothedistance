Its derby/company visiting weekend so I&#8217;m going to be relaxed on the nutrition front. The derby venue&#8217;s food options are abysmal so I got really hungry this afternoon. Eventually I also got headachy, not sure if it was food- or elevation-related, our hike today started above 9000ft and went up!

&#8211; tea
