8 loops around Antrim Lake is a kinda boring. But it&#8217;s 9.6 miles for a knee that is still a bit finicky. So my weekend mileage ended up being 14.6, that&#8217;s all right with me. 

I tried to keep it slow, and I did find that a few times when I started speeding up a bit (it just felt so great to actually be running!), my knee felt a bit sensitive. It&#8217;s funny, 10 minute miles seems painfully slow, but it really is only 2 min per mile slower than my marathon pace: which is what Galloway suggests all your long runs should be at (not that I&#8217;m a galloway fan). So I&#8217;m just going to be ok with my pace and concentrate on feeling fine as I get my mileage back up. Only 7 weeks til Disney, and I NEED to get at least a 20 miler in there somewhere!

**edit:** oh yeah, I should note that I only stopped at 9.6 because I stopped for water and stretched, and my quad started to hurt a bit. The ole knee was all ready to keep going!
