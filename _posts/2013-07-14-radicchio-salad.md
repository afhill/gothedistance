So I didn&#8217;t actually know what radicchio was when it arrived in my Door to Door Organics box last week. I used leaves of it in my morning smoothie for a few days before I took the time to find a recipe to try it out with.

The [radicchio salad recipe I found](http://www.amateurgourmet.com/2013/05/a-really-good-radicchio-salad.html) used anchovies in it, so I started improvising and eventually ended up with a tart salad that reminded me of my Mom&#8217;s coleslaw. (This could have started since it&#8217;s red). In all, it was a good experiment!

Chopped radicchio  
dijon mustard  
red plum vinegar  
garlic  
olive oil  
raisins  
lemon juice

I probably would have also put in apples if I had them. The mustard gave it a nice tangy taste &#8211; if I ever mistakenly end up with radicchio again, I&#8217;d give this another go!
