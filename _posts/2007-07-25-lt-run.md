So I grabbed my results from Monday&#8217;s lactate threshold run.

Goal: 8 miles with 4 at half marathon pace.&nbsp; 

My current HMP is 7:48, although my goal for the year is 7:24 to qualify for NYCM. I ran the 4 miles at a respectable 7:35 pace.&nbsp;&nbsp; My average heart rate for that time was 170, hitting a max of 184. 

You can definitely tell how I was struggling at the start:

8 miles, 1:10:50. (8:51 pace)

First 3 miles: 10:38 pace  
LT 4: 7:35  
last mile: 8:31

Yesterday was a rest/cross training day, I opted for the rest. Today I&#8217;ll meet Mike, Meredith, Mary (?) and Doug for our mid-week run. I have 11 on the schedule, not sure how far they&#8217;re planning on going.
