Last week when she was in town, my Mom and I had some good mother-daughter time shoe-shopping.. for running shoes! We headed over to the <a href="http://www.boulderrunningcompany.com/" rel="nofollow">Boulder Running Company</a>, where they video-tape you running on a treadmill to assess the type of shoes you need. She got regular running shoes, and I took the opportunity to pick up some trail running shoes.

I always worried that I wasn&#8217;t getting trail shoes with enough support. As it turns out, I have a very neutral gait, so the actual problem may have been that I was picking shoes with too much support! I strayed from my beloved sauconys and picked up some brooks cascadia 4s. I was amazed by how light they felt: they were cushiony and comfortable.

Today I decided to take them out on their maiden voyage. We got a reported 8 inches of snow on Thursday, but only two days later much of it is melting. The sun was shining brightly so I headed out in shorts and a long-sleeved shirt. I ended up at <a href="http://www.co.jefferson.co.us/openspace/openspace_T56_R86.htm" rel="nofollow">South Valley Park</a> (a park I haven&#8217;t run at before). I wanted to take my camera with me, but was worried about dropping it in the snow and slush.

The trail was a bit of a mess, but the sun was shining and it was a fantastic day for a run! As well, I wanted to really try out the new shoes! I scrambled over red dust and snow, in part amazed by how many other folks had already explored the trails since the recent snowfall.

While my shoes didn&#8217;t keep my feet dry, they certainly held up well on the run. My trail shoes in the past have left me with calluses on the side of my foot, and I felt great during and after the run. I will admit, every time I hit the trails in Colorado I feel completly humbled. THIS is some hard running! 

I thought about a recent blog post when I wrote about [time on my feet](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/03/time-on-my-feet/) and Meredith claimed that speed was equally as important as time. As I struggled up 356ft and down 225ft in a single mile, I knew that this was significantly more of a workout than most any run I&#8217;d done on a flat surface! 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/slush-225x300.jpg" alt="slush" title="slush" width="225" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-881" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/slush.jpg)

When I run the trails here, I never really force myself into a certain time or distance: this helps alleviate some of the pressure, and brings the fun back into the run. I told myself 6 or 8 miles, or an hour, would be a good run. As a wound my way from trail to trail (I ran on the Coyote Song Trail, the Swallow trail, the Lyon&#8217;s back trail and the Columbine trail), I found myself nearing my car at 57 minutes, so I finished what I consider a great run of 5.25 miles.

Time: 57:35  
Pace: 10:57  
AvgHR: 158  
MaxHR: 177  
Ascent: 1069ft  
Decent: 1113ft

The shoes passed the test and I got sufficiently muddy/slushy to consider this a successful trail run!
