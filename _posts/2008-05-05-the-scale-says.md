At the Flying Pig Expo on Saturday, there was a booth for Body Composition Analysis. Basically you stood on a tanita and answered a few questions, and they tried to sell you a $130 scale.

I always struggle with the &#8220;do you workout more than 10 hours a week&#8221; question. I don&#8217;t measure my exercice by time, so I have to think about it. The administrator said it was basically just asking if you were athletic or not, so I said yes.

The results:  
weight: 118.8 (I&#8217;d like to think this is heavy, since I was fully clothed and over-hydrating!)  
% body fat: 15.5% (underfat)  
% total body water: 60.5% (just over average)  
muscle mass: 95.2 lbs  
physique rating: 8 (on a scale of 1-9, &#8220;thin and muscular&#8221;)  
basal metabolic rate (calories I need at rest): 1344  
metabolic age: 12  
bone mass: 5.0 (below average &#8211; should be ~5.8)  
visceral fat rating: 1 (on a scale of 1-12)

So overall he gave me an A+, but there was some concern about my bone mass. He suggested I do weight training, which I know I should be doing. I already tagged [Melissa](http://itsamonkey.blogspot.com) to help me come up with a plan. (And I picked up a book about short bike rides in Ohio that will help with cross-training)

Also, Wednesday Mom and I are going for massages, I&#8217;m going to give the deep tissue massage a try. I&#8217;m excited, I already told my Mom if it&#8217;s good I hope to cry a little. 

I&#8217;m trying to stay healthy and feeling good. So far things are going well for me, and I want to keep it that way!
