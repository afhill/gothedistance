Weight: 109.3. Whoa. I should just stop weighing myself bc I think this is wrong. 

Oatmeal with wheatgerm, hemp seed, almond butter and blueberries.  
Mango  
Amazing meal  
Hummus, pita and veggies  
Peppermint tea  
2 Oranges  
3 chips ðŸ™‚ and guacamole  
Roasted salmon, brown rice, steamed spinach, tomatoes  
Banana

Today we had &#8220;joint travel team&#8221; practice. I skated hard where I could and did my PT exercises when I couldn&#8217;t ðŸ™‚ I was a bit sore from yesterday&#8217;s working out, but I see it as progress! We had practice til 2 and a meeting at 4 so some of us went to a nearby bar/grill for dinner. Unlike last time when I really wanted nachos, this time I was craving something healthy (the hummus was as good as it got!)  
Tonight I made a good dinner (so far this food prep is still a novelty) And then around 11 I realized I hadn&#8217;t done my wii active workout! Since there are only 20 workouts in the whole program, I didn&#8217;t want to miss one, so at 11 I started in on jump lunges and squats.
