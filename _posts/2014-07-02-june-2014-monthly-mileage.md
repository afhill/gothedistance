Remember when I used to do this? As I get back into running and training, I may as well start up again!

I decided to start a run streak in June. It actually didn&#8217;t even last the whole month; I twisted my ankle hiking in Lake Tahoe on the 28th so I took the 29th off. But still, 29/30 days ain&#8217;t bad!

I had two decent weeks of around 35 miles, and two easier weeks. I&#8217;m ok with that as I ramp back up. My total for the month was **113 miles**. A far cry from last year before my surgery but this is now P.S. (post-surgery) so the game has changed. 

I did do one race, the [Garden of the Gods 10 Mile Run](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2014/06/garden-of-the-gods-ten-mile-run/). It was no joke! It was humbling but also fun just to be out at events again. I have another race planned for next week as well. Yes, starting to feel like a runner again!

In addition to running, I&#8217;ve done some biking and a little bit of strength training (3 hours of Stand Up Paddleboarding in Tahoe as well!) but not a ton. When I move back to Denver next month I&#8217;ll be able to get back into cross-training as I save myself a couple hours of commuting a day!
