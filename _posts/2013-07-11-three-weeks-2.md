**Hey! I have pics of my knee scar down there. I think it looks good, but if you get squeamish, you may want to skip this one**

Today marks three weeks since my [mosaicplasty knee surgery](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2013/06/seriously-super-surgery-with-dr-david-grauer-and-flatiron-surgery-center/ "Seriously Super Surgery with Dr. David Grauer and Flatiron Surgery Center"), and my third PT appointment. And what a day!

My appointment went well &#8211; all the exercises are fine and Erika said I could start going to the pool for rehab starting this weekend. She told me to focus initially on just walking in chest-deep water, or if I wanted to do some basic swimming drills to use a pullbuoy so I didn&#8217;t kick. She said I&#8217;m not ready for pool running yet but maybe next week. She lent me a swim book last time I was there, she&#8217;s definitely a major supporter of Operation (Not So) Reluctant Triathlete!

Of course, before I can get in the pool, I need to be free of the steristrips over my scar. She told me to just go ahead and take them off (its been 9 days). I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would hurt, so she took one off and I set to stripping off the rest of the strips myself. It was a bit surreal to see my little naked (well, I had shorts on) leg on the table!

Dr. Grauer seriously did an awesome job. The places where the scab is already gone look amazing, and I feel like this&#8217;ll be essentially invisible once it has some more time to breathe.

On my way home from PT, I was a block from home when I saw the FedEx truck heading away from my house! I stood actually IN the street and waved him down with my crutch. He stopped, and I asked if he&#8217;d just tried to deliver to [my address]. He said yes, and asked what I&#8217;d done to my leg. I told him &#8220;I broke my knee, which is why I need the bike you just tried to deliver!&#8221; So he took a loop of the neighborhood while I headed home with a big smile on my face. My bike arrived! (Details in my post &#8220;[The new wheels](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2013/07/the-new-wheels/ "The New Wheels!")&#8220;). My friend Eddie took the bike out to give it a try since I&#8217;m still too scared to be off the trainer, and immediately the neighbor asked if the bike were for sale! (I hould have asked him what it was worth to him ðŸ˜‰ ). I joked that since I couldn&#8217;t exercise, I had nothing better to do than buy things on eBay! 

What a great day! Lots of progress being made &#8211; and I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m halfway through my time on crutches! It really has seemed to fly by.
