Last Friday I started a new job, less than a block from NW, where most of my running buddies work. A group of them meet virtually every day at lunch to run. I have always maintained that once I started at RI, I would be out there with everyone! (There are some logistics to work out: namely, RI doesn&#8217;t have locker room facilities, so I may have to join a nearby gym solely to shower post-run). 

Today I was sitting outside at chipotle gorging on a 1100 calorie burrito and &#8211;whoosh! there goes Brian across the street, out for his run. I debated yelling, but kept quiet. Then along comes Doug. At this point I did holler out at him and he stopped to say hello. Yes, here I am eating far more food than I need, enjoy your run!

Next week &#8212; next MONDAY &#8212; I will check out the gym&#8230; !
