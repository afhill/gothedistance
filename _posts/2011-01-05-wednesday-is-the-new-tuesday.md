With my three-day-a-week plan, I do have some flexibility when I get in my workouts. Yesterday morning I woke up with a pain at the top of my shin/right below my knee. I drove to the gym but decided not to run on it. Instead, I did some weights on the machines. Through the course of the day, it hurt more as I walked on it, so I was glad I didn&#8217;t push it. 

I woke up this morning feeling much better, so I went for my speed workout. 

10-20min warmup  
5x(1000m @ 4:16), 400m RI  
10min cooldown.

I am really trying to convince myself that the track isn&#8217;t short, b/c these workouts are all going well. I aimed for 40sec per lap, 6.25 laps to make up 1000m.

1: 4:02  
2: 4:07  
3: 4:06  
4: 4:08  
5: 4:05

Overall: 5.9miles in 49:12.

The run went really well. I am very comfortable with that pace. It almost just seems like &#8220;going through the motions&#8221;. 

As I near the end of this training cycle, I can definitely see myself doing this plan again, but probably bumping it up another notch to push the pace a bit more. Overall this has been a great plan.
