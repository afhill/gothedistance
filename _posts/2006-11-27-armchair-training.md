Since I can&#8217;t get out and run (well, I guess I could run outdoors, contaminating the neighbourhood with my chicken poxiness), I&#8217;m trying to figure out a good plan for when I can get running again! I am serious about wanting to get into NYC next year. This year I didn&#8217;t train near as hard as I could have, and I still managed a PR (however slight). I think with the proper dedication, I can shave a few minutes off my half time and get in there! 

I know I have endurance, the secret is getting that speed up. So I&#8217;m looking at some different plans to figure out how to structure my time. 

I know I wont&#8217; be running as much as I did in 2005, when running was seriously one of my only commitments. Now I have school (Wed nights from Jan through the end of March), and home obligations. However, I am also working from home 2 days a week (Tues and Fri), which frees up roughly three hours on each of those days. This past fall I ran with Meredith and Mike on Wednesdays, it would be great if we could do that on Tuesdays! Plus I joined the gym again so I want to get in at least one treadmill workout a week (who&#8217;m I kidding, I will be lucky to get in one). I likely won&#8217;t run Sundays or Wednesdays, so I&#8217;ll need to figure out how best to get in my miles..
