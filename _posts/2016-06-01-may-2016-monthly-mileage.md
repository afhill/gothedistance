I ran 122 miles this month, over 19 days. Longest run: 26.2 ðŸ™‚ 

My goal is to get back up over 40 mpw, despite the fact I don&#8217;t have a target marathon (for time) on the calendar. 

Upcoming Races (June-Aug):  
Avery 4k on the 4th  
Barr Trail Mountain Race  
Georgetown to Idaho Springs Half  
Pikes Peak Ascent
