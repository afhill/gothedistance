Here&#8217;s the finisher&#8217;s photo we had taken at the end of Vegas &#8212; Mom PRed in the half (it was her second) and I ran the full.  
As Meredith says, &#8220;like daughter, like mother&#8221;. The day after the race, Mom was already thinking about the next race. So for Christmas I purchased her entry to the Flying Pig (and of course, one for myself!) So watch out Cincy, the Running Hills are on their way!<br clear="all" />
