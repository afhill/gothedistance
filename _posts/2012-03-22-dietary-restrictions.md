Today was a weird day, food-wise. I got my [food sensitivity list back yesterday](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/03/my-body-wants-me-to-be-paleo/) and haven&#8217;t yet fully processed what they all mean for me in my eating habits. 

I was getting my car serviced so I stopped at starbucks and got a soy chai (soy > milk, and I&#8217;m not allergic to sugar). My stomach was NOT happy with me. All day I felt this weird rebellion against the clean eating I&#8217;ve been doing. I guess on some level I was almost swapping the list of things I shouldn&#8217;t eat (yogurt is a no-no? well candy is ok! _Note: I didn&#8217;t actually eat candy_). It was almost as though I could only consider one negative consequence at a time. If I couldn&#8217;t have grains b/c of an allergic response, I&#8217;d have something sugary instead&#8230; ignoring that that too would elicit a negative (insulin) response. 

I went to dinner at Casa Bonita, this cheesy theme restaurant with horrible food. Thankfully my friend Laura who is vegan came with me &#8211; she kept me honest in getting a weak taco salad with no cheese. I skipped the taco shell, although I did have the corn tortilla chips &#8211; AND I treated myself to sopapillas with honey for dessert! I was soo hungry (though not to the point of hangry.. I don&#8217;t think) and again, I felt like I&#8217;d done well in avoiding cheese. I guess it&#8217;s all just a process in learning how best to fuel my body for health.

However, I do plan to continue eating beans and quinoa, so not everything will quite fit. I suspect I may need to let loose of labels (as convenient as they are) and just spend the time to learn what&#8217;s ok and what&#8217;s not, as I did with eating clean. 

Today happened to be the day I received my week of vegan meals from [Gobble Green](http://www.gobblegreen.com), so my freezer is stocked for awhile! Pretty well everything looks like it&#8217;ll be ok for me, save one chocolate peanut butter cookie. I&#8217;ll be eager to see how it all tastes and see if there are any new meal ideas in there for me!
