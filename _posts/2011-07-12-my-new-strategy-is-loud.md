Today was a bit of a stressful day at work, but it made me excited for practice, where I could focus my energy. Normally, things could go either way: either it&#8217;s a great practice where I get my aggression out, or I get frustrated with all the pressure of the day. Happily, it was the former and I left practice sweaty and feeling good. We did a lot of agility, which I was happy about as it&#8217;s something I want to work on. I was step-step-stepping a LOT and told my captain that &#8220;my new strategy is LOUD&#8221;. So far, it seems to work. 

#### Food

  * nectarine
  * farmer&#8217;s rye toast with almond buttter
  * smiling moose veggie sandwich &#8211; ordered in for a client meeting
  * probar superfood slam
  * pistachios
  * dried fruit
  * veggie &#8220;cheese&#8221;
  * sugar snap peas
  * blue corn chips
  * subway veggie delite on whole wheat honey oat, no cheese, red wine vinegar dressing. Some folks got LittleCaesar&#8217;s pizza, I was glad there was a subway nearby. The &#8216;sandwich artist&#8217; commented on my muscles, asked what I was training for, and offered me the non-fat dressing options ðŸ™‚ 

#### Exercise

I&#8217;m trying to keep up with my 3 quality runs a week, so this morning I ran to the track, then did the Awesome Jammer Workout run workout: 2 minutes warmup, then 8x(30 seconds sprint, 1:30 recovery). It was hot, and I walked some of the recovery rather than running. I felt stronger as it went on, though. I averaged about a 5mm on the sprints, with the fastest being 4:40mm. Ten I ran home, with a total distance of 3.25miles. Then tonight I had an intense, sweaty 2hr MHC team practice.
