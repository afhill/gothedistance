It&#8217;s really not my fault I didn&#8217;t get that last long run in..

Last Friday night I was at work until 8:30pm and then went out for dinner and drinks with the company owners and another member of the leadership team. 

Saturday I had to leave for the airport at 10am to head to Dallas for a conference I was speaking at. My colleague and I worked together for much of the day. 

Sunday morning we presented a workshop (how social media and social marketing are transforming emergency preparedness) from 8am to noon, and then at 5pm I had a flight to Austin. I concentrated on pulling things together for a social media bootcamp I was co-facilitating on Monday and Tuesday. 

Monday was Social Media Bootcamp and the organizers wanted to take we presenters out for dinner and live music. I begged off to try to get a run in. The hotel was on the highway, and was pretty windy, so I headed for the fitness center:

Dear Wyndham Garden Hotel: a glassed-in room with one treadmill, one elliptical and one bike sitting outside in Texas does NOT a fitness center make. 

After 6 miles on the dreadmill, I was absolutely dripping sweat. 

Tuesday morning bootcamp started at 8am, so I had to be in the room to set up at 7. We wrapped up at 4:30 and headed straight to the airport. My flight got canceled but I managed to jump on another flight and got in around 9:45pm.

I had brought several days of running clothes, with great intentions to knock out some good miles. Really, I tried.
