So I had a thought the other day coming home from work.

Columbus and Chicago a week apart probably wasn&#8217;t smart. But I just recalled a nice little run next month called &#8220;Huntington&#8221;, which is a nice flat course. I already know a PR isn&#8217;t in the works for Sun, but maybe I can try to taper afterwards for a nice run on Nov 5th??

Ha, nothing like taking the pressure off!

(I have a race report to write, but I keep forgetting my watch to grab my splits!)
