So a week after my mosaicplasty knee surgery, how am I feeling?

Well the week has had its ups and downs. I felt outstanding the first few days: I had expected to be in a lot of pain and feeling really out of it, but I felt pretty good! My parents were in town so we did a little bit of sightseeing and overall I thought this was going to be a piece of cake! As the week has worn on, however, reality has set in a bit and it&#8217;s proven to be a bit of a challenge..

Wednesday: surgery day: 9/10. I didn&#8217;t feel sick, I was able to eat. I was really glad I had hurried to get the procedure done once my diagnosis was confirmed  
Thursday: again I felt decent, no real pain or weakness. Sleeping came a little less easily as I tried to toss and turn but really couldn&#8217;t ðŸ™‚ Still, probably an 8.5/10  
Friday: I was really feeling like this was not so bad! Decided to cut back on the percocet to every 6 hours from every 4. 9/10

Drove up to Mt Evans with my parents &#8211; my big joke was &#8220;the doctor told me to elevate my leg!&#8221; 9/10  
Sunday: &#8230;and then Sunday rolled around, and it was time to get back to reality. I came home from the hotel where I&#8217;d been with my parents and all of a sudden things seemed difficult. Thankfully, I have an amazing roommate who has made things so much easier. She suggested I get a shower stool rather than perch on the side of the tub, then went and got it for me. She also made us lunch! Then some classmates came over for a few hours to work on some stuff, and I anxiously shifted in my chair and tried to stay comfortable and focused. I also didn&#8217;t take any Percocet during the day after the pill at midnight the evening before. 8/10  
Monday: Back to work (thankfully I work from home!!) and I was surprised that I was able to focus on things and work ok. However, food turned out to be a problem &#8211; it was just a pain to have to get up and crutch to the kitchen, stand on one leg to make something, then hobble back. So&#8230; I didn&#8217;t. All I made all day was two smoothies (although I did go to dinner before class). I even felt weak and dizzy when making them. I was again touched by the kindness of friends &#8211; my classmates picked me up, got the food I wanted from the cafeteria and carried my tray, and drove me home after class. I started to have some weird crackling in my knee when I move it, which made me nervous. Also, I&#8217;m starting to get concerned/confused why everything I read says I should be using a continuous motion machine, and I&#8217;m not. Am I setting myself back? 6/10  
Tuesday: I made a concerted effort to eat better during the day, and called the doctor&#8217;s office first thing in the morning. So glad I did! They said I could take the dressing off my leg and rewrap it, that crackling was normal, and that I can bend it up to 70degrees if I want (no need for a machine). What a relief! The day started out well, but by the end of it the heat made me miserable and I was starting to develop a headache. Started as an 8/10, faded to a 6/10  
Wednesday: Slept poorly all night, and when I woke up with searing pain in my neck and head I called off work and slept til nearly 2pm. In the evening the exercycle I&#8217;d ordered from Amazon arrived, so I tried to use it a little to get my leg going. The first revolution took effort, but it certainly got easier! No pain. So the day definitely improved as it went on. Started as a 5/10, improved to an 8/10

That brings me to today, which was better. Had a better day focusing on work, I ate better AND had a friend come visit and take me to dinner! It&#8217;s still tough-going, but at least I feel I can work on recovery some. I&#8217;m thankful it&#8217;s only a 3 day week next week. Even though I don&#8217;t have much to do here at home, it&#8217;s nice not to have anything to do! 8/10
