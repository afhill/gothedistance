Last night I was reading an excerpt of &#8220;Thrive&#8221; by vegan Canadian athlete [Brendan Brazier](http://www.brendanbrazier.com/), and in it he mentions that our cells regenerate every 7 years. We all know that. But how do they regenerate? It&#8217;s directly tied to what we put in them. We literally are what we eat.

I take a few supplements in the morning to ensure I&#8217;m getting what I need. A few quick tablespoons and shots, and I&#8217;m ready to start my day!

Bazi:  
Vitamin A &#8211; 100%  
Vitamin C &#8211; 230%  
Vitamin D &#8211; 100%  
Vitamin E &#8211; 200%  
Thiamin &#8211; 35%  
Riboflavin &#8211; 30%  
Vitamin B6 &#8211; 40%  
Folate &#8211; 100%  
VItamin B12 &#8211; 25%  
Biotin &#8211; 100%  
Pantothenic Acid &#8211; 25%

Hemp Oil (I&#8217;ve been tested for low essential fatty acids before)  
Omega-3 Polyunsaturates &#8211; 2.5g  
Omega-6 Polyunsaturates &#8211; 8g  
Omega-9 Monounsaturates &#8211; 2g

Blackstrap Molasses  
Potassium &#8211; 12%  
Calcium &#8211; 8%  
Vitamin B6 &#8211; 10%  
Iron &#8211; 20%  
Magnesium &#8211; 8%

I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;m not as good about taking vitamin capsules as I am about these. But I have a one-a-day, a calcium/magnesium supplement, vitamin d, iron and glucosamine I try to remember to take as well. Obviously I try to eat well too but this just helps me be confident that I&#8217;m getting what I need.
