630: smoothie- kefir, spinach, banana, orange, cantaloupe, protein powder  
9:30 oatmeal, pb, hemp seed.  
Noon: veggie bowl: rice, black beans, salsa, guacamole. I placed my standard order with chipotle (yes, I use their iPhone app and have saved orders), and then realized there was cheese on it. So I carefully picked out as much as I could.  
Also &#8220;food should taste good&#8221; blue corn chips.  
1:30 apple  
3:00 Oregon chai from a machine  
4:30 energy nut butter ball  
5:30 banana  
8:30 apple  
10:00 dates

I&#8217;m a sucker for marketing, so when I saw the &#8220;ninja master prep pro&#8221; on the shelf by all the boring food processors and blenders, I decided I needed to have it. Its nice and powerful and elegant. Waay better than the hand blender I&#8217;ve been trying to use. I foresee more smoothies (and hummus and other stuff) in my future!

#### Exercise

AM:  
Abs  
2x(1 min each of:  
Bootstrappers  
Pushups on upside down bosu  
Pulsing Squats  
Plank on upside down bosu)  
I also used the foam roller on my IT band for 4min per side. 

PM:  
20 min crossramp (3890 strides)  
leg Extensions: (105lbs 15 12 11) &#8211; last time I did (105lbs 15 12 10)  
​Leg Press: (180lbs 3&#215;15) &#8211; last time I did (140lbs &#8211; 12, 180lbs– 12, 10, 8). I&#8217;ll up the weight next time.  
Weighted squats (70lbs 3&#215;15) &#8211; last time I did (50lbs &#8211; 15,12,10). I&#8217;ll up the weight next time.  
​donkey Calf Raises: (75lbs 3&#215;15) last time I did ( 75lbs – 15, 12, 10). Guess what I&#8217;ll do next time?  
Captains chair 20 straight leg lifts. Really felt nothing  
Hip adduction (50lbs 3&#215;15) groin was sore so the weight was really low.  
Hip abduction (50lbs 3&#215;15). Easy but wanted to keep the same weight as adduction

I managed to get a lot of my kitchen stiff unpacked tonight so I can actually have food prepared. Hurrah!
