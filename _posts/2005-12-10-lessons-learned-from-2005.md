This was a [post on the runnersworld forums](http://forums.runnersworld.com/thread.jspa?messageID=7341953), and I really liked it. I have my own list, but I encourage you to take a moment to think about what you learned this year&#8230;

pallasgypsy: _So we&#8217;ve had the &#8220;highs & lows of 2005&#8221; thread, the &#8220;how many races have you run in 2005&#8221; thread&#8230;so ready for another one? :p Since some of us (cough, cough) have had less-than-stellar years, I thought it would be beneficial to focus on the positives and think about what valuable running lessons were learned. Maybe PR&#8217;s weren&#8217;t set, maybe PW&#8217;s were&#8230;maybe your training was slacking or non-existant or presented so many hurdles you thought you were on the track & field team&#8230;but inevitably, at the end of the day, running is the sort of sport where you always walk away with more than you came, with revelations both profound and mundane.</p> 

So what momentous lessons of running have you learned this year? Common-sense rules of running you never paid heed to but now honour them? Not-so-obvious insights and deeper revelations that have come to fruition & helped you grow as a runner? Post &#8217;em! ðŸ˜€ Best wishes to all for a stellar 2006 running year!</i> 

My list: <lj-cut>  
1. Have a firm goal in mind. Let it seap into you, own it, become it. Don&#8217;t ever doubt yourself.

2. You don&#8217;t have to prove anything to anyone but yourself.

3. As runners, we give ourselves a second of leeway: we get disappointed when we run 3:41:00 rather than 3:40:59. That&#8217;s self-defeating.

4. It&#8217;s ok to change goals or plans. (See #2). Do what feels right to you at the time.

5. Running is a sport we can hopefully do for decades. No use injuring yourself for one day (particularly a training day!) and putting a future in jeopardy.

6. The best runs are the ones you have to drag yourself out to do..
