Before being eligible to be drafted to a team or participate in Wednesday night &#8220;scrimmages&#8221;, every member must demonstrate their knowledge of the rules and ability to skate safely. 

When inducted, each member of the DRD is considered a &#8220;B&#8221; skater. As quickly as 60 days after induction to the league, a member may be invited to &#8220;test-up&#8221;. Based on their test results, they may be ranked as an &#8220;A&#8221; or an &#8220;A-&#8221; skater. Both A and A- skaters may be drafted to a team and participate in scrimmages, but only A skaters can play in bouts.

I was invited to test-up this week, which consisted of a written test on Wednesday night and a skills test last night. This made for a pretty busy week since I ran the Boston marathon on Monday and traveled on Tuesday! 

The [rules](http://rules.wftda.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/wftda_rules_v3_1.pdf) are all available on the WFTDA website, but I wish I&#8217;d googled the rules and come across this slideshow before taking the test! (Although, I&#8217;m not sure what version of the rules they&#8217;re based on; we&#8217;re on 3.1.)

The written test was more difficult than I expected.

Then last night we had the physical test. I was actually pleasantly surprised at how recovered I am from the marathon: it would have been a shame if I&#8217;d still been hurting. The test-ups were long; it took about 2.5 hours for the 10 of us! I felt all right on the basic skills parts. When it came to falling, I was worried my knees wouldn&#8217;t cooperate but they seemed to be ok. 

The last two parts of the test are the most intimidating: the blocking drill (where A skaters hit us), and the time trial. We had one of our really hard hitters participating, so we anxiously watched our friends take hit after hit. When it came to be my time, though, I stayed on my feet pretty well! I was often hit out of bounds, but I stayed up.

Last was the time trial. We did two waves of 5, and I was in the &#8216;fast&#8217; wave. We were being graded on our 5 lap time and 20 lap time. We got started, and I quickly found myself at the back of the pack. Although my legs weren&#8217;t sore, I just didn&#8217;t quite have all the power I generally do. In derby, the fastest way around the track is to go wide on the straight-aways and close on the corners, and I found myself getting &#8220;cut off&#8221; by the other skaters. I finished my 5th lap at the back of my group, thinking &#8220;See? Not a sprinter!&#8221;. Ah, yes, but then the endurance part of the drill kicked in, and I found myself steadily gaining on the other girls. I picked them off one-by-one to the cheers of the others waiting to be tested. As I neared the end of the test, the last girl in the pack was in my sights again and I gave it my all, lapping her just as I hit my 19th(?) lap. I kept going, wanting to catch the others. Then I noticed everyone slowing; so evidently I&#8217;d miscounted and pulled off a victory lap; 21 laps in all.

I stopped skating and immediately wished I had my heart rate monitor on. I&#8217;m pretty sure I hit an all-new high! I was coughing, which used to be common after hockey, but almost never happens anymore. My lungs ached and I was sure that was the effects of oxygen debt. Good &#8211; speedwork without pounding my knees!

Then it was all over, and I headed the 45 min drive home, still coughing and with a ringing in my ears. When I got home my heart rate was still 106, high considering I&#8217;d just been sitting in the car, but no indication of what I&#8217;d hit. I woke up this morning and my chest is still sore. As I&#8217;ve said before, I wear the pain proudly; I know I pushed myself!

So now it&#8217; s over but the waiting. We have 48 hours to find out about the physical test and I believe the written test results will follow soon after. Now that it&#8217;s over I know I shouldn&#8217;t stew about it, but I know I&#8217;ll be anxious until the results come. I think my biggest concern is that the written test won&#8217;t have gone well, because I didn&#8217;t get much of a chance to review the rules in the days before the test (we were only invited Tuesday night; not sure why I didn&#8217;t think to review them &#8216;just-in-case&#8221;)

Needless to say, I&#8217;m giving myself a day off from cardio today!
