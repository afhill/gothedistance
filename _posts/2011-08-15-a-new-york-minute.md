This weekend I went to New York for roller derby, and came back with a renewed passion for running. I stayed with [Elyssa](http://www.bridgesrunner.com/) and her friend BK, both runners in the middle of some serious training. We did an easy 6 miles Friday morning, and on Sunday Elyssa and I did another 6 while the rain poured down on us. It was sooo much fun.  
Beyond the running was that easy kinship runners share. We talked about training philosophies, recovery and nutrition, and debated on how much matching apparel was too much. It struck me that Elyssa and I have only met in person three times: once at the Steamtown marathon, once when she came to Colorado to stay with me to run Pikes, and this weekend. And yet we get along extremely well due to our shared passion. 

Hearing about their training regimen and upcoming races and goals lit the fire under me again, and I signed up for a half marathon in October after an evening spent talking about goals. We shared our stories of relays, and she invited me to join their [Spring Reach the Beach](http://ma.rtbrelay.com/) relay. 

I realized (again.. I keep realizing this but really not making any changes) how much I miss running, and those special types of friendships shared between road warriors. Unlike roller derby where there is always competition (someone loses and someone wins, someone gets play time and someone doesn&#8217;t), there is a different level of mutual support and respect in distance running. 

I already have a running date lined up for Tuesday, and of course a few serious runs this weekend, but after that I&#8217;m excited to get back into a more formal regimen. This weekend&#8217;s runs were so much fun I actually exclaimed to Elyssa that I was sorry Mondays were her rest days because I wanted to go out again! I will definitely be making some changes to renew my efforts in the sport I&#8217;ve been neglecting.
