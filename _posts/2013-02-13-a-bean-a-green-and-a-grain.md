I don&#8217;t recall who first coined that phrase, but that&#8217;s what kept going through my head as I made this [Kale, quinoa and white bean stew](www.theppk.com/2010/10/quinoa-white-bean-and-kale-stew/). I&#8217;d had some extra kale left over from last weekend so decided to find a recipe for kale and white bean soup. I was happy to find this version with the extra addition of quinoa! I improvised a bit based on comments to the recipe, and what I had at home.

<ol style="clear:both">
  <li>
    Saute garlic, chopped carrot and squash in olive oil.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add fennel seed, thyme and rosemary.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add in ~7 cups veggie broth, 1 cup uncooked quinoa and two tbsp miso paste. Bring to a boil.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lower temperature and simmer covered for ~10 minutes
  </li>
  <li>
    Add in kale and white beans. Take picture.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir, then let simmer for another ~5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Burn tongue trying to taste
  </li>
  <li>
    Take another picture
  </li>
  <li>
    Enjoy!
  </li>
</ol>

I gravitate more towards turmeric, cumin, coriander when I cook. So I wasn&#8217;t sure how I&#8217;d like the flavor of this stew, but it was really good! I didn&#8217;t miss the potatoes, either &#8211; even without them, the stew was nice and thick. I really liked the addition of quinoa, as well. This is a full meal deal!
