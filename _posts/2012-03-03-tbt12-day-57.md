Its saturday and i realized i never finished my post from thurs. I keep a log of what I eat through the day, but I suspect this one is missing some?

I went for a massage after work, one of my last at massage envy. Ugh- maybe for some people nearly falling asleep on the table is a good sign, but I get massage to wake up my muscles! Then I packed for my trip, wheeee!  
&#8212;

I woke up from SUCH a deep sleep this morning I didn&#8217;t know what day it was. I actually had to look at my phone to see it was Thursday. I decided that was a sign I should get up a bit slowly, out rush out to a run.

#### Food

&#8211; Egg white omelette with mushroom, tomato and a touch of crumbled caraway havarti cheese  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; kombucha  
&#8211; good belly drink  
&#8211; [spicy, citrusy black beans](http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/spicy_citrusy_black_beans/) on toasted Ezekiel pocket bread. Soooo good! 

#### Exercise

&#8211; 9.3 mile run. I was feeling anxious about it, and kept trying to convince myself to cut it short. Happily, I didn&#8217;t.
