went out for a nice lil 10 mile run yesterday, in preparation for the Columbus Mini 15K tomorrow. Headed over to the bike path, I haven&#8217;t run much lately so I initially told myself I&#8217;d be happy with sub-9:30s. 

I hit the first half-mile at 4:17, and told myself that sub-9s would be good, so long as I could sustain it through the whole 10 miles.

I suffered from the same problem I tend to have: I would like I was struggling, then realize it&#8217;s because I&#8217;d sped up. I kept trying to tell myself to slow down, but in the end I was still pleasantly surprised with how I was doing and feeling:

1: 8:23  
2: 8:09 (a bit short)  
3: 8:21  
4: 8:28  
5: 8:20. Stopped for a few minutes. Felt really great, felt pretty confident I would continue well under 9s  
6: 8:33  
7: 8:36

Then the wheels fell off. My knee had given a brief twinge in mile 6, and now it came to a grinding halt. Literally: I could feel things moving with my hand as I tried to bend my leg. I walked for close to a mile before slooowly doing a combination of walking and jogging back to the car.

Disappointing: I don&#8217;t know if I just was pushing it after doing 9 on Sat with the gang, then a quick 25 min on Thurs, before trying for the 10 on Friday, or if the whole &#8220;not going to the gym anymore&#8221; was kicking in or what. The speed I was going felt decent when I was running, I was pleasantly surprised at how familiar the pace felt. I woke up this morning with my knee still hurting, but over the course of the day it&#8217;s been feeling better, so hopefully the race tomorrow will go ok.. I&#8217;d like to do 8s but I really don&#8217;t want to do any serious damage. I was almost wondering if it was some light ITB flaring up&#8230;
