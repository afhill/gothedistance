June was an odd month for me: I ran my 25th marathon on June 7th, which I actually tapered for. Then I decided to spend the rest of the month working on some heart rate training, so keeping my heart rate below 138 for most of my runs for the rest of the month. I traveled twice: to Clearwater Beach, Florida one week and to San Jose the next. I was also doing some mad roller derby in preparation for my first bout.

All that to say that my mileage was low: 63 miles all month!

I also biked 10 miles, went to 10 (2hr) derby practices, and went to yoga 3 or 4 times.

Of my heart rate monitor runs, I actually did see some improvement over the course of the month.

Week 1: pace b/t 13:06 &#8211; 12:36  
Week 2: pace b/t 12:54 &#8211; 12:48  
Week 3: pace b/t 12:41 &#8211; 10:14 (the 10mm was in Cali. Wow, I hate altitude! ðŸ˜‰ )  
Week 4: pace b/t 11:48 &#8211; 11:18.
