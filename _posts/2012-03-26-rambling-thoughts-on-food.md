Yeah, this blog will probably have much more on food for at least the next little while. You&#8217;ve been warned&#8230; But really 95% of what I write is for myself anyway. I don&#8217;t write it with an external reader in mind (as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve guessed)

-written on a plane and in a hotel room.  
&#8212;-  
Food is both personal and political. I started eating clean as a personal decision. My food choices stemmed from a place of information and empowerment. 

My recent allergy tests have surprisingly affected my approach to nutrition more than I would have expected. Now my personal choice of what to eat has seemingly been imposed from outside: a report from an unknown label with big red flags next to dairy, egg whites, gluten, bananas and cocoa beans.  
Obviously, my choice to honor these recommendations IS up to me, but it doesn&#8217;t feel the same. I chose to take on the TBT diet, these restrictions chose me. 

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not feeling sorry for myself for having a wheat sensitivity. From my friends with celiac disease, I know I&#8217;m nowhere near as affected as they are. And there are plenty of options out there. But balancing the various restrictions makes my personal diet, well, personal. 

Breakfast while away from home is the biggie. Even when I cut out white flour I noticed how carb-centric North American breakfasts are. Toast, bagels, croissants, wheat cereals&#8230; Over the past year my consumption of eggs for breakfast has greatly increased just to avoid white carbs.  
And now.. Eggs are on the no-no list. How about non-wheat-based cereal? Only if there&#8217;s non-dairy milk (and even if it&#8217;s technically fine for me sensitivity-wise, I try to avoid soy milk). Oatmeal it is! (again, with non-dairy milk please and thanks)

I picked up a book on the paleo diet for athletes as they prescribe no processed foods, no dairy, no grains. However&#8230; They place a strong emphasis on animal products for protein. I&#8217;m a vegetarian so I have to be careful in that regard. They also are much more restrictive in terms of pseudo-grains and legumes. Obviously I don&#8217;t need to follow a given diet to a T but it makes me wonder if the rest of their approach makes sense given my body&#8217;s proclivity for some of the aspects of the diet. 

It&#8217;ll be tough, no doubt. I guess in some respect if I adopt this way of eating I&#8217;ll be an unintentional vegan. Now THERE&#8217;S a label that carries certain connotations! I do bristle when people assume that the veg*n diet is low-fat, high-carb by definition. It&#8217;s low (no) animal! It&#8217;s just really going to be about figuring out where that fat and protein will come from. 

I&#8217;m willing to admit I&#8217;m a bit apprehensive about taking this all on. Cutting white carbs helped me increase my fat and protein through dairy and eggs, but now I&#8217;m facing eliminating sources of all 3? (although I suppose arguably that may keep the ratio intact) 

Looking at a breakfast menu for tomorrow, options seem bleak. Even the granola (probably sugared) and oatmeal come with my one fruit no-no, banana. For real? 

I texted Frida about it (my actual text was &#8220;i really want eggs for breakfast&#8221; and she supported me in saying she thinks we should cut things out one at a time. I&#8217;m actually fine trying to take on (by keeping off) dairy and gluten right away. Eggs are a different story..

There is lots of anecdotal evidence about the negatives of dairy and wheat. Even before the allergy test, I was shifting in this direction anyway. But I wasn&#8217;t prepared for this egg white thing and I guess Im not quite in a place to recognize the health benefits I gain from removing this protein source.  
I do have one truly good option for the morning, I could get a fresh fruit platter and not have them bring the yogurt. I just don&#8217;t relish the idea of all fruit for breakfast. I tried that for awhile and I just really want a heartier breakfast. So eggs it is, allergies be damned. 

(and I need to acknowledge that beyond the allergies, it&#8217;s more that I feel like I&#8217;m choosing to be weak. Do I NEED eggs? No. I could have willpower. But I&#8217;m choosing to ignore what I &#8220;should&#8221; do)
