I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was going to run this morning. My friends were meeting at 7:30, and at 7 I looked at the temperature &#8211; 3F! I texted them to say I was going to pass. At 8 I got ready to head to the gym, but once I got outside I figured it wasnt _that_ cold, so I went back inside, bundled up, and headed out for my run. 

Before I got my wonky hip, Jay had given me a workout for today in preparation for my race. **EDIT: Now that I go back to look at it, I had it wrong, but this is what I thought it was:** 10 miles. The first few easy, then pick it up, then mile 9 a bit faster than race pace, then a last mile easy. I figured I&#8217;d at least go out easy and see how I felt, but I gave myself permission to keep it slow or shorten the workout. 

It was certainly cold to start out, but I felt good and enjoyed running along with music &#8211; I rarely do that anymore! I started with country and folk and just enjoyed being outside in beautiful Colorado. I noticed in the first mile that I was throwing back a perfectly acceptable pace, especially since I couldn&#8217;t feel my toes! 

I cruised along the route we&#8217;d used last week for our fartlek run, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that at 25 minutes I wasn&#8217;t too far off the turn around point we&#8217;d used for that workout. I felt good, and although my hip wasn&#8217;t perfect, it certainly didn&#8217;t worry me at all in terms of feeling like I had to be careful about it.

I squeezed up the pace a bit, but still didn&#8217;t worry too much about hitting a certain pace. In all, I felt really strong and good, and I had confidence that I was executing the workout well without micromanaging my pace. Less than 16 minutes later I was at the turn-around point. The nice thing about this course is that it IS uphill on the way out, so I knew the return trip would feel great!

Oh! I&#8217;d had my playlist on shuffle, but part way into mile 4 Girl Talk&#8217;s &#8220;All Day&#8221; came on. I adore this song to run to, and it&#8217;s over an hour long!! So I knew it would be the song that would bring me home. It&#8217;s also much more upbeat than the Dar Williams and Taylor Swift I&#8217;d been listening to, which I figured would also help me on the way back. 

Sure enough, the minute I turned around, it was like I smelled the barn. I dropped the hammer, and actually DID have to force myself to hold back a bit. I really wanted to fly, though! Soon enough mile 8 came and I let myself go. I was a bit faster than race pace and I was shocked with how short the mile seemed! It wasn&#8217;t the easiest thing in the world but I was definitely able to get the legs going and settle in. Although Jay&#8217;s original instructions had been for a pace a bit faster than race pace, I&#8217;d have been thinking it was good to settle in on that pace to get used to it, but I felt fine just a little faster. Then that mile was done and I had one final &#8220;easy&#8217; mile to complete. Of course, once you&#8217;ve done a fast mile, easy is relative, and I still came in nice and quick.

I am SOOO glad I went out today and got this race in. It definitely was a huge confidence and excitement boost. My hip felt fine (I did have one brief mind-attempt-to-sabotage-me moment when I watched my shadow to try to assess if I was limping. I told myself to shut up and ignore me) and I nailed this final workout. In all, 10 miles in 1:18 (a 7:47 pace)

I did double-check this morning on pace groups, and I&#8217;m no longer sure there will be one for me next week, so I need to mentally prepare for how I&#8217;m going to execute. Honestly, my run went so well today I&#8217;m considering running with music exactly how I did today &#8211; a few easy feel-good country/folk at the start so I don&#8217;t go out too fast, then All Day for the majority of the race ðŸ™‚ The only thing I need to consider is if I want to try to create a playlist that&#8217;s pretty well exactly the length of my target race. Heaven forbid something goes wrong, will I completely fall apart if the song ends before I do? Something I ponder&#8230;
