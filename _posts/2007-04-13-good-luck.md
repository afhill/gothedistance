Good luck to all my friends running Boston this year &#8211; and a very happy 29th for Meredith on that day! Sounds like the weather will make it extra challenging..

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to run the Distance Classic tomorrow. The forecast is rain and/or snow, and I know it wouldn&#8217;t be a good race anyway. Besides, I&#8217;ve already put in over 50 hrs at work this week, so sleeping in will be great!

My history for that race isn&#8217;t great&#8230;

2004: my &#8220;return to racing&#8221; after taking time off due to injury  
2005: registered, but ended up with strep so I missed it (the year it snowed)  
2006: used my transfer entry from the year before  
2007: registered, but may skip it (and it may snow)
