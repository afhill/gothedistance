So this Sunday is the Rock and Roll Denver race, I&#8217;m doing the half to qualify for the New York marathon. It&#8217;s been awhile since I really had a target goal (<1:37:00) and pace in mind, and I'm working my way back to my old mindset. Loren is running her first marathon Sunday, so we're going to do for dinner to carb-load on Saturday. I'm also thinking I'll watch the Run for your Life video Elyssa gave me last year. Watching or reading about running the night before a run is tradition, but watching a video about the New York marathon is extra-special. 

Yikes &#8211; I&#8217;m getting butterflies just listening to the trailer while writing this!

Today I&#8217;m wearing my Boston08 shirt, and I&#8217;ll be wearing running shirts tomorrow and Saturday as well. Focus&#8230;.focus&#8230;.

Elyssa also emailed me last night to tell me they&#8217;re changing the qualifying standards for the 2013 race: 3:00 marathon for women, 1:27 half. (right now it&#8217;s 3:23 / 1:37). So&#8230; it&#8217;s now or never!

I am registered for the half in Houston in January so that can be a backup plan.. but I want this 1:37 monkey off my back and to know I can run in the Big Apple next year! I&#8217;ve trained hard.. it&#8217;s time.
