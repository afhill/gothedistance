It&#8217;s been a LONG time since I had such a dedicated week of training, and I feel great for it!

With about 3 weeks to go til the Eugene Marathon, I&#8217;ve started eating clean and doing the Beachbody Insanity workouts as well as running. And I feel fit and strong! 

A run-down of the past week:

**Monday:** [Insanity fit test](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2016/04/insanity-fit-tests/), 4 mile easy run

**Tuesday:** Insanity Plyometric Circuit, and an interval workout with Revolution Running.  
The workout was: warmup, then 4min @ 10k pace, 5x2min @ 5k pace, 4 min @ 10k pace, then cooldown. My target was 7:15/6:45 paces. Didn&#8217;t quite get there, but I was ok with how I did given the wind!  
(1) 4min: 7:20pace  
(1) 2min: 6:58  
(2) 2min: 7:12  
(3) 2min: 7:16  
(4) 2min: 7:01  
(5) 2min: 6:59  
(2) 4min: 7:18 

**Wednesday**: Insanity Power and Resistance

**Thursday:** 3 mile easy run

**Friday**: Insanity cardio recovery (which was a lot of planks and holding squats), Indoor rock climbing

**Saturday**: 20 miles in just under 3 hours (8:53 pace) &#8211; note that I DID stop for some water or &#8220;breather&#8221; breaks, the three hours was actual run time.

**Sunday**: XTERRA Cheyenne Mountain 12K race. Note that my watch said it was only 6.11miles, not the 7.45 that would make it a 12K. Still &#8211; a solid run, and I placed 3rd in my age group. Not bad considering Saturday&#8217;s run!  
Then I got a nice 90min massage &#8211; great for all my aches and pains from the week (abs, glutes, quads, back&#8230;.)

Total: 41 miles running, 2:20 [Insanity (Max Interval training)](http://club.teambeachbody.com/program/insanity) workouts

Over the week I ate a TON of protein and really watched my sugar intake. I felt like I had a ton of energy and got in some great workouts. I am going to keep up with the Insanity workouts for another week or so before truly tapering for Eugene &#8211; I dont want to risk being sore for race day!
