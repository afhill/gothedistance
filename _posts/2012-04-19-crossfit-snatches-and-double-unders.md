I read this workout last night before bed, grimacing. Double-unders should be easy &#8211; it&#8217;s just jumping rope where the rope passes beneath you twice within one jump. But I can&#8217;t do them. Also, I&#8217;m a big ball of sore after my workouts from the last few days. Last night I ran a nice hard 4 miles in minimal shoes and have shadows of what would have developed into blisters on my forefoot and toes had I run any further. 

>   * Build to a heavy snatch
>   * AMRAP in 10min 
>       * 20 Double Unders
>       * 1 Snatch 85#/115

Modifications were on the menu for today!

The last time we did snatches, I got up to 42# (we did a series of them). Today I worked up to 67#, but I just felt awkward. I&#8217;d overthink the movement too much. 

When it came to the AMRAP, I stripped my bar down to 57, and the coach told us that if we couldn&#8217;t do double-unders, we could do singles at a 3:1 ratio. So, I had to do 60 singles per set. He said we should expect to do between 7-15 sets.

I actually liked the jumping rope as I was able to play around with the speed a bit. The first few sets I went unbroken (this fell apart as I tried to concentrate on speeding the rope up). 

The snatches were&#8230; not hard at all. Once I stopped concentrating, my body just did what it was supposed to. I was actually bummed I&#8217;d dropped the weight down. 

In the end i did 11 sets with another 48 singles. Loren rocked the house with the highest reps of the whole class! Whoo hoo! 

It was a good workout (my back is hurting now though&#8230;), but I am a bit disappointed I really didn&#8217;t even try to learn how to do double-unders. I think it&#8217;s probably just something I need to put the time into on my own, but it&#8217;s tough when the workout gives you no incentive for it..
