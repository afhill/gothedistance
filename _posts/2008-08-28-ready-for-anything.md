I was cleaning out my closet today and came across a packed gym bag. An interesting fact about me: at any given moment I have one or two gym bags packed and ready to go (often complete with shoes). I&#8217;ll pack a bag, and then if I don&#8217;t use it, I won&#8217;t bother unpacking. Sometimes I may add additional items if I think the weather will be different than what I initially thought. .

So anyway.. today&#8217;s gym bag. I unpacked it, and was amused at what I had:  
[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/packed.jpeg" alt="" title="Running gear" width="124" height="166" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-557" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/packed.jpeg)

I don&#8217;t even know what pair of shoes those are: I have been alternating two other pairs faithfully, and these ain&#8217;t them. I don&#8217;t know how I managed to pack \*three\* head coverings, and believe it or not, this is still an incomplete pack &#8211; no socks!!
