Tonight I was at my beloved [All Sports Recovery Club](http://allsportsrecovery.com/), working a bit on my left knee with the cold laser when club owner [Josh Shadle](http://allsportsrecovery.com/Therapists.aspx) came by. Earlier in the day I&#8217;d been talking to [Todd Straka](http://boulderrunner.posterous.com/) about my thoughts about my left leg scar and IT band affecting my running. I mentioned it to Josh, and asked what he thought I could do. He suggested either massage or a technique called [muscle restoration](http://tri-massage.com/muscle-restoration), where they investigate imbalances and work on them. Since I know I continue to have some imbalances, I was intrigued what he could uncover. He mentioned that they had a massage intern available right then, and said if I were interested, he&#8217;d help her work on me. Sounds good!

So while I generally avoid getting massages right after a workout because I feel self-conscious about being sweaty, I headed back. Josh did some basic tests that very clearly demonstrated some significant weaknesses on my left side. Most notably, I was lacking hip rotation and he said that my glute wasn&#8217;t firing effectively. He explained this didn&#8217;t mean I wasn&#8217;t strong, it just wasn&#8217;t functional. Perhaps he&#8217;s used to working with athletes who get defensive thinking they may have weaknesses&#8230; he used the analogy that the overhead light can be powerful, but if the switch is off, it&#8217;s useless. 

After the strength tests, he had the intern work on my left glute, apparently my piriformis muscle was prettytight which felt so good and so bad all at once. After awhile, we did the strength test again &#8211; and it was remarkable how much stronger I seemed! Hurray!

Then he had me to do a quick jog down the hall and stairs, and came back and do the test again. And I was back weak again. dammit.. 

Honestly, it was a bit sad to see how the shortest of jogs seemed to undo the work the massage had done. I asked him about it, and he said it&#8217;s simply habit. I&#8217;m accustomed to recruiting certain systems when I run, so I really just need to focus on activating my glute, testing it, activating, running, activating, testing, etc etc to change up the patterns I&#8217;ve fallen into.

The intern then went to work on my IT band directly, which again hurt soo good. I could actually feel it throbbing a bit on the drive home &#8211; yow! 

In all, I was super glad I&#8217;d stopped in and chatted with Josh. I did sign up for a 30/30 session with him for next week &#8211; 30 minutes of what I&#8217;m sure will be the most painful massage of my life, and 30 minutes of this &#8220;muscle restoration&#8221;. I&#8217;m excited!

I know that I have come a LONG way since my injury last year, seeing the strength differences tonight clearly show me there&#8217;s much more progress that can be made. And then? Watch out! 

Oh &#8211; the title? When I made my 30/30 appointment they went to add notes to my reservation and I suggested they add that in summary. Hey, it&#8217;ll be a great reminder, he won&#8217;t forget who I am when he sees it!
