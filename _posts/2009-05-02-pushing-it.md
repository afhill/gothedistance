Last Thursday was my first day back at derby after test-ups. I&#8217;d been allowed to attend the Wednesday scrimmage, but I had a rough day at work and didn&#8217;t want to get discouraged at derby the first time out. 

I didn&#8217;t really think about it, but testing up to A- indicates that I&#8217;m at a higher level than some of the other skaters. I noticed as we were doing the drills that the trainer (Bea Ware) had her eye on me (she also ran test-ups). Quite often she&#8217;d make comments on how I was doing (&#8220;good speed skating position, Andrea&#8221;, &#8220;Andrea &#8211; what are you doing to better your jammer&#8217;s position?&#8221;). I know it&#8217;ll definitely help me continue to improve at a higher level, but it was a bit of a surprise at first!

I grabbed my Garmin to check my heart rate, and then realized I could also use it to help me count laps! We started skating, and I did well, lapping quite a few girls. At one point Bea said &#8220;so this is just like the marathon, right?&#8221; (I&#8217;m now known as &#8216;the marathon girl&#8217;). I looked at my heart rate: it was 189! Not quite like the marathon!

We kept skating and once or twice I wondered if I&#8217;d remembered to hit the lap button. Then the trainer called out &#8220;Andrea &#8211; you&#8217;re done, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Other people I&#8217;d passed were finishing up. How sad that I was the one tracking laps on a watch and I miscounted! In the end, I did 54 laps. I wasn&#8217;t overly careful about hitting the button right as I passed the pylon, so these numbers aren&#8217;t exact, but overall I was able to see that I really didn&#8217;t slow down at all during the drill:

In the end I mentioned that my heart rate had gotten up to 194, within 3 beats of my perceived max. Bea said she was surprised at that, but I explained that I was an endurance athlete, I&#8217;d rather go long and slow than fast. I AM glad to be doing this sort of cardio in derby, though! It&#8217;s great cross-training without the jarring!
