This has been a great year for me, running-wise. As I head into the home stretch for Houston, I feel like I just continue to get stronger. I’m recovering quickly after my runs, despite running harder and for more miles than ever before. 

So&#8230; I may have a secret weapon.

It improves aerobic threshold, reduces lactic acid and speeds recovery &#8211; these results have been demonstrated through [clinical trials](http://xendurance.com/science/). It’s all created in a factory certified not to have any banned substances. For me, this means it’s legit – they are truly trying to create a product elite athletes can use. 

Endurance planet had a discount code available, so I figured I’d give it a try. I didn’t want to say anything in case it was a waste of money. But… I started taking in in October and I know I’ve seen incredible improvement since then.

Granted, I also started running with the RRB at that time, but I don’t know that simply running with them would have delivered the results I’ve seen. Every week I feel like I see improvement, and it’s definitely in the arena of aerobic threshold and recovery. 

There are a few athletes who’ve done testimonials for them, but it&#8217;s worth noting that many athletes using the product may not want to give their secrets away. I know I felt hesitant to try the product at first because I wasn’t sure if it worked, but now I feel like I want to share this knowledge with others, to see if it can help them too!



The recommended dosage is 6 capsules a day (3 in the morning, 3 in the afternoon) if you work out 6 days a week. Then the week before competition, you are supposed to increase to 8. I’ve been taking 2 capsules a day (when I remember to take the second..). I will be upping my dose the week before Houston. I honestly think that this supplement is helping me, and I’d love to hear any reports from anyone else who’s given it a try!
