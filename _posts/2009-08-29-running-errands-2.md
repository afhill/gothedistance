When I was in college, I used to rollerblade errands. I&#8217;d throw shoes in a backpack and head off to whereever I needed to go. When I started running, most of my trips to the local ATM were incorporated into a run. 

I have a compulsion to be always productive, so rollerblading for the sake of rollerblading rarely happened. But if there were an errand to be run, I gladly took the opportunity to do strap on my skates. (wow, it feels odd to consider rollerblades skates). 

Fast forward.. several years. Due to a mishap with my work visa, I don&#8217;t have a valid license. If errands are to be run, I can either do them self-propelled, or find someone to take me. The excuse I&#8217;ve been waiting for!

The one problem with literally running (or biking, or skating) errands is the time it takes. I&#8217;ve had enough trouble dedicating myself to long runs because of the amoung of time it ate up, and two-footing it to the store definitely takes longer than driving. Yet because I&#8217;m being productive, I don&#8217;t see it as a choice &#8220;to run or to do something else&#8221;. It&#8217;s just a different way to achieve the task on to the to-do list. 

_ok, wait. I rarely delve into my random deep linguistic thoughts on here, but I can&#8217;t help it. In English, we say &#8220;he rolled across the street&#8221;, where &#8220;rolled&#8221; describes the action and the direction. In French, they say &#8220;il a traverse la route, en roulant&#8221;. Well, something along those lines&#8230; as I said, college has been awhile. Anyway &#8211; in French, they say &#8220;he crossed the street, rolling.&#8221; They don&#8217;t mush together the behavior and the descriptor. Right now I&#8217;m thinking of the difference between running errands, and running errands running. Ok, done._

The other week during the Pikes Peak marathon, I decided that I wanted to get a small backpack for running that I could have used for my gear. Now that I am carrying work clothes and a lunch every day on my bike, a decent backpack seems more important than ever. Guess what errand I&#8217;m running today? Home -> REI.
