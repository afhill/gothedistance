I havent done much updating lately about getting ready for New York. Overall my training is going ok. My #1 goal is 3:45:00 to get guaranteed entry into Chicago next year. Sure, a BQ (3:40:00) would be nice but I&#8217;m not going to worry about it. As it is, it [doesn&#8217;t look like they even have a 3:40 pace group](http://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/plan-your-race/tcs-new-york-city-marathon-pace-team-powered-by-tag-heuer) and I think I want to try to stick with a group for this race.

So I&#8217;ve been getting in decent mileage, roughly 35-40 a week. I missed my 20 this weekend because I&#8217;ve been fighting off something, but I&#8217;m not too stressed about it. Since my training started on Aug 11th, I&#8217;ve gotten in long runs of 15, 16 (x2), 18, 20 and 26.2 miles.

I know I can do the distance, for me the bigger unknown has been pace. Happily, I&#8217;ve seen that I&#8217;m getting pretty comfortable with my race pace. Note that other than one treadmill workout the other week, I havent done any sort of target pace running, I just get out there and run by feel. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m feeling faster! 

First week of training:  
8 mi &#8211; split 2 @ 9:45 and 6 @ 9:30  
9mi @ 9:33  
15 mi in 2:23 (9:30 pace)  
Recovery 5 (10:07 pace)

Most recent week of training (I notice that I have lowered my mileage even apart from the missed long run, which is kinda weird. Slacker&#8230;):  
5.75 at 9:04  
10.1 at 8:37  
6 at 8:35  
5.5 at 8:22

It&#8217;s a great feeling to look at my watch during what semes a totally reasonable effort and see it up around 8:20 or so. Finally! 

I haven&#8217;t really been doing any sort of real speedwork coming up to this race, I just want to feel comfortable sticking with my target pace (8:35) for the distance. 

This is why I like training and tracking things &#8211; it&#8217;s cool to go back and see progress being made, even without forcibly going through, you know, a real training plan and specific workouts. 

Three weeks! Hard to believe!!
