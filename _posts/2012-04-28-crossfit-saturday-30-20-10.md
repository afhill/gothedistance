Today I dropped in on the free Saturday workout at Crossfit Lohi. It was pretty busy, and since it is a drop-in, I figured it would be of lower intensity than a regular workout. 

Perhaps lower &#8220;intensity&#8221; isn&#8217;t the right word. Lower skill level, perhaps? Because the workout was tough, there just weren&#8217;t any intimidating lifts to worry about.

> 30-20-10 of:
> 
>   * ground-to-overheads with a 25 lbs weight plate
>   * jumping lunges
>   * burpees
>   * sit-ups
> 
> Between each set as well as to start and finish, we did a 200m run carrying the weight plate (4 runs in all)

I&#8217;d considered a heavier weight-plate, then just went with the 25. The carrying was the most awkward of the whole workout! 

I am definitely starting to nail the crossfit burpees where you throw yourself down onto your chest. When I first tried them in our intro classes, I hurt my shoulder something fierce. I&#8217;ve figured out the technique now. I went to the bathroom afterwards and thought I had a line of boob sweat across my pink tank top. Nope! It was dirt from the floor (ewwww), definitely proving I&#8217;d done the prescribed &#8220;Chest to deck&#8221;.

In all, I finished i 15:34. I was pretty happy with it. I got the vague discomfort in my stomach that tells me I was up above my aerobic threshold. Nice!

Then because it was someone&#8217;s 27th birthday we had to do 27 air squats, then hold at the bottom for 27 seconds. I&#8217;m glad no one was turning 45! 

Obviously I can&#8217;t normally make Saturday workouts b/c I run, but it was nice to be able to drop in and get a great workout in!
