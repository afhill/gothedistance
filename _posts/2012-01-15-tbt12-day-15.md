Whoa! 

I ran the marathon (26.2 miles) in 3:09:52, nearly 20 min faster than my previous best. Needless to say, that was my exercise. 

After white bread Fri and sprite and tiramisu yesterday, I wanted to keep it clean today. 

Whole wheat bagel with Justin&#8217;s honey peanut butter  
Tea  
Gatorade  
Water  
Homemade energy gel (orange, pineapple, chia seeds, brown rice syrup, fruit pectin, sea salt)  
Honey milk  
Clif bar sample  
6 inch subway veggie sandwich on 9-grain honey oat  
Veg out sandwich plus avocado at einsteins on whole wheat  
Veggie enchiladas, no cheese, no rice plus refried beans (not great but protein was a priority)

I skipped the beer in the lobby, margs and chips and sopapillas at dinner. Just wanted to give my body good food to help with nutrition. Now my coach says no running for a week so I guess I&#8217;ll be lifting/crossfitting!
