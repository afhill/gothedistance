I&#8217;ve been reading my &#8220;vegan bodybuilding and fitness&#8221; book and it&#8217;s got me definitely conscious of how much I take in. I burn a lot of calories and I can&#8217;t build muscle without eating a lot. So I&#8217;m really trying to eat more. So far I think it&#8217;s been good for recovery. 

Exercise  
&#8211; 6.6 mile run with KJ. Fun! Great start to the weekend  
&#8211; Kettlebell class.
