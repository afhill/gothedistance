#### Food

  * tea
  * healthy egg mcmuffin: whole wheat English muffin, egg whites, veggie bologna
  * bolthouse green smoothie
  * smoothie: yogurt, egg whites, banana, orange, beets, pear, frozen mixed berries, glutamine, hemp protein powder, flax seed, chia seed, mustard greens
  * sugar snap peas
  * homemade trail mix- now with soynuts! (also almonds, raisins, peanuts, goji berries)
  * apple
  * tofu veggie bowl
  * wine and liqueurs
  * raw veggies

#### Exercise

  * 5.5 mile run. Felt good! I did try to throw in a couple sprints, and my right leg just didn&#8217;t seem to be as quick as my left. No pain, though, which is most important. Now I need to start thinking about whether I&#8217;m running the Colfax half or not. I have entry for the marathon and for $10 I can transfer to the half. Obviously, I&#8217;m not running the full. 

Tonight we had a wine tasting fundraiser for derby. I knew I wanted to drink so I gave myself permission to drink twice this week if I ate well. It was tough to resist the food tonight: chocolate merlot cake, smoked salmon and cream cheese on cucumber slices, gorgonzola cheese and candied pecans on apples, and more. But I kept my resolve and stuck to raw veggies.
