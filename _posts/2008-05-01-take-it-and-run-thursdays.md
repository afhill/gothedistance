I recently started reading [Heather Daniel](http://heatherdaniel.wordpress.com/2008/05/01/take-it-and-run-thursday/)&#8216;s blog, and she posted a link to the [Runner&#8217;s Lounge](http://blog.runnerslounge.com/2008/05/take-it-and-run.html), where people are supposed to ask a running question and wait for people to answer. So I figured I&#8217;d give it a try:

**1. How do you focus your training plans for different distances? i.e. post-marathon, how do you prepare for a 10K?**
