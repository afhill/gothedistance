Today&#8217;s speed workout was a doozy: I&#8217;ve been dreading it for awhile now:

10-20min warmup  
1mi in 7:02, .25mi RI  
2mi in 14:24, .5mi RI  
2x(.5mi in 3:23), .25mi RI  
10 min cooldown.

First off, looking at a mile at around a 7 min pace is a bit daunting. However, when I broke it down into my nice .1mi laps, it was 42 seconds a lap, which isn&#8217;t too bad. Then when I had to run 2 miles at a 7:12 pace, the pace went to 43 seconds a lap, but of course it was having to maintain that pace for a longer period of time that would be the challenge. And then at the end of it, I had to run shorter, but faster? (40 seconds a lap)? I yi yi&#8230;

But, training only works if it&#8217;s hard (but not impossibly hard), right? So I headed to the gym and set to work&#8230;

1. timed mile: 6:53 pace (target: 7:02)  
2. timed 2miles: 14:24 (target: 14:24)  
3. timed half mile: 3:20 (target: 3:23)  
4. timed half mile: 3:16 (target: 3:23)

It&#8217;s crazy to me that I was exactly right on the two miler, but I guess micromanaging the distance every tenth of a mile helps! I was really happy to meet/exceed all the other times too. 

With the warmup, cooldown and rest intervals, my overall run stats were: 7.05miles in 1:00:54. Average heart rate was 163, max heart rate was 186.

Next up: the Turkey Chase on Thursday! I had 6 miles on my plan anyway (I think it was one mile warmup, then 5 miles at 7:50) so I&#8217;ll be doing this 10K race. I haven&#8217;t decided yet it if I&#8217;ll run it as my plan dictates, or try to race it. I set my 10K PR just after moving here (45:55/7:24) and given my training lately, I&#8217;m tempted to try to break it..
