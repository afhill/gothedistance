Woke up today not really feeling super, its funny how one day can make you sluggish! But then I actually got to running and felt good! Cheri and Annie both started the run saying they felt a little tired (both ran yesterday &#8211; Annie did doubles both Wed and Thurs), but I actually felt better than I did on Wed. We met the Bruesses &#8211; I do like our little group and how we can chat a bit, and run in silence a bit.  
Rick said he wants to get up to 65/70MPW. I mentioned that in my discussion w/ Jay we&#8217;d said that 45-55 was a standard base for me and beyond that would be &#8220;new&#8221;, but if I keep running with these guys all the time I&#8217;ll definitely be pushing my mileage! We did just over 7 today, so I&#8217;m already at 32 for the week before tomorrow&#8217;s workout and a Sunday long run.  
Paces are good &#8211; today we averaged 8:41 with a few strides and I definitely felt strong throughout. It&#8217;s set to get cold and snow this weekend, so we&#8217;ll see how the workout tomorrow goes..

Oh, and I feel bad posting this stuff daily so I&#8217;m going to go back to long-winded weekly wrapups.
