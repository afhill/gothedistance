Yes, so it&#8217;s starting. As of today (Feb 21), I&#8217;m going to be doing a 90 Day Total Body Transformation program. I hadn&#8217;t thought I&#8217;d actually follow the same program, but I figured in the end it was good to have a set length for the program and measurable goals. So, here we go. 

Just today Frida and Queen posted a little [primer on doing the TBT](http://90daytbt.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/so-you-want-a-total-body-transformation/), which makes it easy for me to explain for others what&#8217;s involved. 

Frida says that I shouldn’t truly be able to call my program a 90 day TBT because I’ve been easing into it for 35 days. But in true marathoner fashion, I’ll just call that “base building” in preparation for my actual program. Also, having today as an official start date means I can do before pictures! Also, I now have an idea of what I want my goals to be (muscle development). So, the program starts today. 

I know the nutrition piece won&#8217;t be _easy_ but I know I can do it. Fitting all the exercise in may be the bigger challenge. Between derby, skating and working out, I&#8217;m basically a triathlete! Subject to change, but here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking, schedule-wise:

Monday am: run (r1)  
Monday pm: legs and back (g1)  
Tuesday am:  
Tuesday pm: skate (s1)  
Wednesday am: chest and shoulders (g2)  
Wednesday pm: skate (s2)  
Thursday am: run (r2) &#8211; this could be tough since we skate til 10pm on Wed.  
Thursday pm:  
Friday am: biceps and triceps (g3)  
Friday pm: yoga or whatever workout I missed  
Sat am: run (r3)  
Sat pm: gym?  
Sun pm: skate (s3)

Our skating schedule flips around a bit so sometimes I may be skating Monday as well as or instead of Tuesday. But this is at least an attempt to fit everything in!

I&#8217;m excited to get going on this. While I&#8217;ve been tracking my food and exercise for awhile, I feel renewed to have a more formal commitment. 

My goal is weight and muscle gain (up to 120), and lower my body fat to 15%. I&#8217;m not quite sure if I can achieve both of those at once; we&#8217;ll see!
