Monday &#8211; run with Rick, Laura, Cheri and Annie.

Tuesday pm &#8211; run with Rick, Cheri, Annie and Beth  
Wednesday &#8211; run with Rick, Laura and Cheri

Sometime in between runs with my friends on Tuesday, giddy with a combination of endorphins and caffeine, it struck me. Boulder is like Neverland.

Rather than fighting pirates, we ragamuffin band of runners glide across paths, the flatirons looming above.

When I met with Rick, Cheri, Annie and Beth on Tuesday afternoon, we giggled like schoolgirls (Ok, Rick didn&#8217;t giggle). We were back in junior high again, getting together with friends mere hours after we went our separate ways. And for an hour or more we cover miles side by side, sometimes speaking, sometimes not. 

Our new coach likes to focus on general strength and mobility, so our workouts include skipping, lunges, planks and other exercises. At 8:00am on a Tuesday, you may very well see a dozen brightly-colored athletes splayed across yoga mats on a frontage road. Jay always asks &#8220;who needs to rush off to work?&#8221; Many of us laugh, pack up our mats and head to the local coffee shop. We linger over the warm drinks, not wanting to leave the others even after having spent the last 2 hours together. Eventually &#8220;real life&#8221; calls, although for many of us that means a flexible work environment until we can next lace up our shoes.

I know I&#8217;ve had an on-again-off-again relationship with running, and part of that was because it was me and the road. The pavement is so much less demanding when you&#8217;re covering it with others. 

We have hard workouts, but so much of the joy is derived from the beauty of the surroundings &#8211; people AND place. Often Sundays we go up to altitude (8500ft as opposed to the 5600ft here in Boulder), and those runs are hard. It&#8217;s hard not to stop and just want to drink in the surroundings. Such small beings covering such large expanses of road. You feel both insignificant and part of something greater all at once.
