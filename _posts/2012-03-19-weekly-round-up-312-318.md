Monday: 6.4mile run

Tuesday: [crossfit in the am](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/03/crossfit-wod-presses-kb-swings-and-pullups/). I didn&#8217;t run with the RRBs because they were meeting in Niwot, which is even further from Denver than Boulder. :-/ Instead, I enjoyed the beautiful weather and did 9 miles close to home. I also did a blood draw for some food allergy testing (I&#8217;m pretty sure this is the [same list of items they tested for](http://www.integrativepsychiatry.net/allerfood_food_allergy_test.html)) &#8211; results come back Friday. I&#8217;ll be interested to see what comes up! 

Wed: I woke up at 5:30 with a horrible headache. Took some ibuprofin and went back to sleep and didnt get up til past 7. Had a decent day at work but wasn&#8217;t feeling terribly motivated to work out. I actually drove out to run trails, and decided to bag the run before I started. It&#8217;s been a good 10 days since I took a rest, and I decided I needed it.

Thursday: [crossfit in the morning](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/03/crossfit-wod-amrap-deadlifts-power-cleans-front-squats/), 4.6 mile in the afternoon. Hit up the Recovery club for compression, the inversion table and the vibration board. I also signed up for the Pikes Peak Marathon and Ascent again! 

Friday: considered taking another rest day as my legs were not happy about the deadlifts on Thursday, but thought I&#8217;d just stretch them a bit. Had a GREAT run (aren&#8217;t those the best?) 4 miles at an 8:20 pace.

Lead my little pace group for 3 of the 4 repeats and exceeded all my goal paces. Total: 10.7 miles. Went to Recovery Club after for an ice bath, compression and the vibration table. Josh took my pic in the bath to tweet to the universe&#8230; 

Sunday: I knew 15.3miles would get me to 50 miles for the week, so that&#8217;s what we did! KJ and I headed out to the Highline Canal Trail. We did a great negative split: 1:09 out, 1:06 back! Another sub-9mm long run. Then I headed back to Recovery Club for an ice bath, compression and rolling my legs out. 

All in all, good week! I haven&#8217;t been going to the regular gym but I&#8217;m ok with that for now. Life&#8217;s been busy (and will only get busier in the future) and I&#8217;m content with the exercise I&#8217;m doing.
