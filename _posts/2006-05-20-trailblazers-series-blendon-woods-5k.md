Today was the Blendon Woods 5K. It was actually primarily on road. I felt pretty good going out; I didn&#8217;t want to ush myself too hard and die. Somehow I&#8217;m pretty sure the mile markers are off:

Mile 1, included a big hill. 7:19  
Mile 2: 7:35  
Mile 3, walked after I grabbed some powerade. This part actually went into the woods and was on the trail we run on during the week. 7:01  
last .1: 1:19  
&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;  
23:13 (7:29 pace)

I believe I was the 4th girl overall. Felt good!
