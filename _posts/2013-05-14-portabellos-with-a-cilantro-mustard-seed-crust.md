Today I also had some cilantro in the fridge and I figured someone had combined the two before. A quick google search and lunch was ready within a half-hour! 

The recipe is from [Eating Well](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/portobellos_with_a_cilantro_mustard_seed_crust.html). It called for a chili sauce to be prepared for the side, but I didn&#8217;t make any. It was super simple:

2 tbsp chopped cilantro  
1 tbsp dijon mustard  
1.5 tsp mustard seed (I only had mustard powder)  
1 clove garlic, minced  
Mix the above together in a small bowl. 

Clean the mushrooms, and sear them rounded-side up for two min on medium-high heat in a cast-iron skillet. Coat the top with the mustard mixture, then put in the oven on 425 for 15 minutes. 

SO. SIMPLE. 

I did have some store-bought chili sauce, but I barely used any. The mushrooms were good, but I almost felt as though I could have added more of the sauce (odd considering I made a full batch of the sauce and half the mushrooms!). These would probably be good for someone who didn&#8217;t actually like mushrooms, as the flavor was really of the mustard and cilantro. Personally, I really like mushrooms just marinated and grilled, so I probably wouldn&#8217;t use this recipe all that frequently.
