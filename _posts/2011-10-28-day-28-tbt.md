So, my &#8220;tweak&#8221; to my back was really a bit worse than that, I had trouble sleeping because of it. Thankfully icing and anti-inflammatories over the course of today helped and I&#8217;m feeling a lot better. But I made today a rest day and I&#8217;m bummed I missed my tempo run. It was a gorgeous day and it would have felt great!
