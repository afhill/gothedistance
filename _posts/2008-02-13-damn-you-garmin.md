  * an even sleeker design than the 305. (no more &#8220;wow, nice \*cough\* watch&#8221; from non-runners)
  * an optional foot pod so you can take it indoors (the only reason IMO anyone wouldn&#8217;t get GPS)
  * wireless syncing to your computer

Seriously, did they really listen to anything negative anyone&#8217;s ever said about past garmin products, and fix them?

Is there an upgrade discount??

(oh, and despite what I read online, the garmin training center is mac-friendly.. I just loaded it up on my \*brand new macbook pro\* and it works just fine!)
