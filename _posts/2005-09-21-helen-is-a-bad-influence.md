Actually the invite came from Paul &#8211; I guess he and Helen are thinking about doing the Detroit marathon on Oct 23rd, and asked if I was interested. I wasn&#8217;t initially, until they mentioned it went underwater and you ran to Windsor. That peaked my interest! Obviously I want to wait and see how recovery after Steamtown goes, but that would check Michigan off the list ðŸ˜‰

Also, I invited alot of the &#8216;running gang&#8217; to get together on Oct 11th to swap war stories. It should be fun. We&#8217;ll have a lot of stories: I&#8217;ll have Steamtown, Jen will have Chicago, and Meredith and Andy will have Towpath (Mike and Bridget are doing a relay at Towpath, too). Oh, and Paul will have the Dayton Air Force Marathon from last weekend. 

My resident manager, Mike, invited me to run with him sometime. I really feel fortunate to have a good number of ppl I can run with. It&#8217;s great to share an interest like that.
