Since getting back from Canada and deciding to get serious about running, I feel a lot more focused and content. I started using [dailymile](http://www.dailymile.com/people/afhill), which I&#8217;d signed up for awhile back, to track my runs. Overall, it was a pretty good week, workout-wise. I&#8217;ve managed to start getting up early again, so I can actually fit in all I want to do.

Monday: easy 2 miles after getting home. Temperature in the 90s.  
Tuesday: lifted  
Wednesday: 6 mile tempo run, roller derby  
Thursday: lifted  
Friday: feeble run (too hot!)  
Saturday: good fast run, roller derby  
Sunday: run

I definitely want to be sure I keep up with my lifting &#8211; I like how I feel and look and don&#8217;t want to lose that just b/c I&#8217;m running more. But running is good for my soul ðŸ™‚  
I&#8217;m going to do a long run with KJ on Friday morning, I&#8217;m excited as it&#8217;ll help the time pass! 

After yesterday&#8217;s bout, I learned that I will be going to Vegas at the end of the month for our game against Bay Area. Guess that means that&#8217;s a weekend with no long runs-which is exactly why I structured my plan the way I did. Hard to believe that&#8217;ll already be after the relay, though! 

My food hasn&#8217;t been great, I had a few beers and some chocolate over the course of the week. But I&#8217;m still trying to fuel right!
