On the first of the year I set my resolution to [run every day](http://spreadsheets2.google.com/ccc?key=pgx4qM2eRki4TlC-_e4XeJA&hl=en) (the day after marathons being the exception). I did forget one day when family were visiting from out of town, but I recommenced after that. 

Today may be the day I purposely don&#8217;t lace up.

It was a really good running week, too. 

Monday: I&#8217;d planned to hit the gym when it opened (5:30am), so I set my alarm for 5, anticipating a few snooze cycles. Instead, a jumped out of bed, dressed and was ready to go by.. 5:06. So instead of driving to the gym, I ran around the neighbourhood for a bit, got some water and a gu, then ran TO the gym (2.5miles), hit the treadmill for a few, then ran back. This also miraculously helped me avoid getting rained on. All in all, got in 12.5.

Tuesday: busy day at work, I snuck in one mile right before bed.

Wednesday: ran three miles before work. I actually forgot that by the end of the day, and was getting ready to run again when I remembered I didnt need to go force a mile in the dark.

Thursday: the joy of the office closing at noon is that sometimes you need to go in at 6am to try to get your work done üôÅ After we got off work, I ended up having a mid-afternoon nap, then headed out for a little run downtown. I wanted to measure out a new route, but crowds were gathering for the Red, White and Boom fireworks display. I ended up shortening the route, but got in four miles.

Friday: hurray for days off! Went to the gym and ran 7.5 on the treadmill (I&#8217;m almost done listening to &#8220;the anatomy of buzz&#8221;, then rode the bike for another 8 miles (solely because I wanted to read the new Runners World magazine). I did some weights, feeling great for the rest of my day! 

Saturday: the gang wasn&#8217;t running together, and I was a bit dehydrated from the night before. I&#8217;d also realized I didn&#8217;t know where my iPod was, so I ran to the gym in the hopes it was there. Thankfully, it was! I considered running further (I had in my head that 10 was a good distance), but I was just feeling sluggish. Less than a quarter mile from the gym, my left knee twinged, so I turned around.  
Ah yes, the left knee. My achilles heel. By mile 4 I noticed that starting to run after stopping at a stop light was no longer fluid. At 4.78 miles I considered stopping at 5 and walking it in. I felt decent while I was running, however, so I ended up bringing it in and running a full 6. Later, I did some yard work (getting a nice back sunburn in the process), and in the afternoon as I was doing some errands I noticed my knee hurting more and more. By the end of the evening it was actively SORE.

Sunday (today): As I sit here, my knee cracks when I bend it. Darnit! I had planned to go cycling with [Melissa](http://itsamonkey.blogspot.com) this morning, but she noticed my facebook status yesterday and kindly encouraged me not to push it. I had told myself to wait and evaluate, but yes, it&#8217;s certainly not doing well.

The week went well, mileage-wise, the most I&#8217;ve done since May. Hm.. any connection? I hope not, since I have a little 50K race I&#8217;m supposed to do in two weeks. Rather, I&#8217;m going to chalk it up to the recumbent bike and the weights (I was doing some heavy leg presses and perhaps my leg was out of line), or maybe the dancing in heels on Friday night üôÇ Anything but this running stuff I love so much!

I will hold out hope that I can put in a couple miles before the day&#8217;s end, but there is no way I&#8217;m going to risk real injury.
