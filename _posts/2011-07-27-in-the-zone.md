Today I took an amazing spinning class at the gym. I lightened the resistance to allow myself to increase my cadence as the class went on. It was tough but I didn&#8217;t hate myself like I often do at the end of spinning. When we finished my legs were shot: I wondered if they&#8217;d let me down the stairs. But more notably, my head was completely clear from the exertion: like runner&#8217;s high. 

I did my best during the afternoon to rehydrate and recover, because Wednesdays are scrimmage nights. We had a half hour of bruising against the league (oh- I&#8217;m back on bruising because I wanted more opportunities to bout and practice), then an hour of MHC against the league. I went in every 4th on bruising and every 5th or so with MHC. I was definitely in the zone: I skated hard (my legs felt nice and loose) and my mind was clear. It felt great!

After scrimmage during MHC I managed a huge backwards fall- it felt like it happened in slow motion. I mostly managed to get my hands behind me but I still hit my butt hard, and ended up stuffing an ice pack down my shorts for the rest of practice. Ow!

I definitely feel like I skate better warm, great for tournaments! The trick is figuring out what to do the rest of the time. I am glad to see how even an hour of intense legwork only helps!
