Day two of my &#8220;cleanse&#8221; and for most of the day I felt great! 

Hot water with lemon  
Tianchi  
[Venice Vanilla Green smoothie](http://fruitata.com/archive/products/venice-vanilla/) from Fruitata (spinach, pineapple, strawberry, banana, vanilla, honey and almond milk)  
2 cups of herbal &#8220;tea&#8221;  
Spicy Sauzi salad from Sweetgreen (yes,again)  
lentil chickpea soup  
panang curry with tofu and brown rice  
lots of water!

In the morning I did some bodyweight exercises and got the heartrate up, and in the evening I went for a run down the end of the marathon course (about 3.5 miles) and then hit the gym for a bit. I was feeling really great from the salads and smoothie, but then I didn&#8217;t want to go to SweetGreen AGAIN (the line was out the door) so I got Thai. It was tasty but I definitely felt &#8216;full&#8217; afterwards in a way I don&#8217;t when I&#8217;m eating raw foods. I probably should have just been patient and got another salad. Ah well, live and learn!

My run felt good to start off with, but then I caught a glance at my shadow and could see how pronounced my limp was. That really frustrated me and I didn&#8217;t enjoy the rest of my run as much. I came back to the hotel and texted my supervisor at work to ask for her PT&#8217;s contact info. I&#8217;ve tried to get better on my own but it&#8217;s just not happening. Being here in Boston has stirred a LOT of &#8216;love of running (and specifically marathoning) and I need to get this injury out of the way!
