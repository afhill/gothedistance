I&#8217;ve been SUPER anxious the past week or two. I&#8217;ve decided that after today, I&#8217;m going to be serious about cutting out coffee. Having a bunch of games lately has let me get lazy but I think I&#8217;m paying for it. 

I also want to start tracking again. I&#8217;m not doing poorly, but I could do better. 

#### Food

  * scrambled egg whites, spinach, tomato, veggie cheese in a whole grain tortilla
  * peanut butter, banana, hemp seed burrito
  * naked green smoothie
  * nonfat chai &#8211; no espresso
  * bazi energy shot
  * vega sport optimizer
  * bananas
  * Cutie (of course!)
  * larabar sample
  * vega sport protein
  * pbr
  * veggie sandwich on whole wheat; forgot to ask them to hold the cheese :-/ 
  * steamed carrots
  * nonfat yogurt with blueberries (also bcaas and glutamine)

I felt less uptight at the game, but I can&#8217;t decide if that was a good thing or not; if I didn&#8217;t have the same fire I sometimes do. It overall made it enjoyable even as we got whipped pretty well, but I can&#8217;t help but wonder if a little fire in my belly helps my performance. I did get to block a bit, which I was excited about.
