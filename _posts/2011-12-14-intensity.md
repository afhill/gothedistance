When I first started training for marathons, I did what most people probably do: I focused on ramping up my miles. In training for Steamtown 2005 I used the Pfitzinger 55/12 plan and started incorporating a bit of speedwork. But I HATED it. Over the next few years Meredith and I would do some speedwork here and there, but generally we stuck to just tacking on the miles. 

Since moving to Colorado and taking up derby, and then lifting and various other HIIT-type activities, I&#8217;ve developed a love for more intense workouts. I feel a sense of satisfaction (as well as a strong hit of endorphins), every workout feels like a real workout! 

I used the &#8220;Run Less, Run Faster&#8221; plan for much of this year, which involves running fewer miles at a higher intensity. There are no junk miles on the program. It worked well, although as I phase roller derby out of my life I&#8217;ve been looking for running to fill a social void as well. Enter running groups galore! So I&#8217;ve given up on the Run Less Run Faster program as I was starting to run more. 

Working with the Running Republic, I get a somewhat generic training plan every week. The crux of the program is the two weekly group runs on Tuesdays and Saturday, which are basically a speed and a tempo workout. Then the rest of the week the plan is peppered with &#8220;easy 6-7 miles&#8221; &#8220;easy 9-10 miles&#8221; &#8220;easy 4-5 miles&#8221;. Just to get the miles in.

I&#8217;ve been getting the miles in, but I haven&#8217;t been so good at the &#8220;easy&#8217; part. For example, this week:

Monday morning: met a couple folks for a morning 5 milers &#8211; we ran a 7:28 pace  
Tuesday afternoon: group run with intervals between 5K-HMP, overall 8.6 miles at an 8:03 pace  
Wedneday morning: I actually DID a recovery run. My legs felt a bit heavy for part of the run but then they loosened up &#8211; 6.7 miles at a 9:11 pace  
Wednesday night &#8211; HTB Run Club &#8211; I totally intended to take it easy and run with a friend, but she had another running buddy so I picked it up &#8211; ran the 4 miles at a 7:50 pace. 

See? Of the 24 miles / 4 workouts I&#8217;ve done already this week (heh, that&#8217;s more than I did all last week, and it&#8217;s only Wednesday), most of them were not what I&#8217;d call easy. Sure, it&#8217;s great to push myself. It&#8217;s a month to Houston, so this is at the height of training and I&#8217;m actually pleasantly surprised with my willingness to push hard. But I know that there&#8217;s a reason we&#8217;re supposed to have those easy days, so we can push hard on the hard days. But it feels good, and steadily I feel as though many of those paces aren&#8217;t so &#8220;hard&#8221; anymore. 

I am so excited for Houston. A 3:20:00 is a 7:38 pace and I&#8217;m pretty confident that&#8217;s well within my abilities. Heck, I was right on that pace for half the race way back at the [2009 Rock and Roll Arizona Marathon](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/01/rock-and-roll-arizona-race-report/), when I was trying to get my New York Qualification. Fast forward a couple years and I&#8217;m a much better runner and overall athlete. It&#8217;s just been a long time since I really trained for and targeted a marathon as seriously as I am this one, and I don&#8217;t want to jinx it by pushing too hard at training and not being able to put forth the effort on race day. 

I&#8217;ll keep running strong the next week and a half, and then once I get to Arizona for the Christmas break, I&#8217;ll consider that my start of taper. I do have that pesky Goofy Challenge the week before Houston, so I&#8217;ll need to account for a ton of miles that weekend (as in, my normal weekly mileage in just two days). 

I know they say you should drop mileage but keep intensity in the taper, but given how many runs I have at a high intensity now, I think I&#8217;ll drop down to &#8220;prescribed levels&#8221; and actually let myself recover a bit more. I want to be sharp and hungry! 

**How many &#8220;hard&#8221; workouts do you do a week?**
