Im reasonably sure high intensity training is what caused me To drop those 6 lbs and become a much stronger runner. I don&#8217;t want to lose that, and I want to become a better jammer, so interval training it is!

Today I did workout #3 of AJW (I missed workout #1):

Bike:  
​Total 30 minutes  
​Warm-up five minutes  
​Sprint with the highest resistance you can do and rest with lower resistance. Mix up the sprint and rest segments in 30 second, 1 minute, 1.5 minutes, and 2 minute intervals. Work towards 2 minute sprints with 30 second rests.

But&#8230;. I sorta missed the 30min part to start, and just increased my segments up to 2min right away. Then I looked again and realized I had plenty of work to do.  
The thing about me is that I much prefer a power workout to a speed one, so I was on the highest gear on my bike.. But had to downshift when I realize there was much more to pedal! I had my HRM on but it died within the first 10min.  
It was definitely a tough workout, but I definitely felt it was a good one!

5min warmup, then 30sec recovery between
