So I must have a really short memory. I&#8217;m considering running the SunBurst marathon on June 4th. I&#8217;d looked it up before Boston and it intrigued me, but I wasn&#8217;t sure how long recovery would take me. Well, I consider myself pretty well recovered! So far this week:  
Monday: 6 miles  
Wednesday: 4 miles  
Thursday: 4.75miles (tempo on the treadmill)

and I feel great! We&#8217;ll see how Saturday goes at Highbanks, but in general I feel really strong. 

SunBurst is 6 weeks away, which is a decent amount of time. I can&#8217;t help but think I could put a good effort into this one, and I&#8217;d be able to make up for the faltering I had right before Boston b/c of strep. The course looks pretty nice too &#8211; so my goal is a 3:35.. provided I decide to run. I&#8217;m not so sure starting a marathon at 5:45 is going to be too pleasant, but other than that, I&#8217;m pretty excited about it. The field is small, which I actually think will be nice. Andy and I were talking, and he said he likes a smaller race b/c it&#8217;s easier to set your sights on someone to track your progress. Indeed, that&#8217;s what made the 15 miler go so well this winter. So we&#8217;ll see&#8211;
