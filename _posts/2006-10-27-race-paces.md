Just updated my list of races I&#8217;ve run.. I really didnt have that great a race year overall. I thought it was interesting that I had the same pace for the Cap City 10 Miler in July as I did for the Home Stretch 20 Miler in September: 8:32. And yet I can run a marathon at sub-8. I think I said this last year, but I really need to work on my short distances..

I did manage to PR in the 5mile, the 10mile, the half marathon and the marathon.
