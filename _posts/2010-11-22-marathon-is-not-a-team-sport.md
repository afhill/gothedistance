On the surface, it seems my running would translate nicely into roller derby: strong legs and good endurance will pay off, right? Yet after nearly two years skating with the Denver Roller Dolls, I&#8217;m constantly made aware of the differences between my two athletic passions.

In running, 97% of your success comes from doing the training. Train enough, and barring some freak weather occurrence, you&#8217;ll likely succeed in completing the event. But throw other people into the mix (teammates as well as competition) and all of a sudden, everything is different. And for a control freak like yours truly, it&#8217;s a tough thing to accept.

In running, if I don&#8217;t achieve a goal, it&#8217;s on myself. I take the responsibility for not achieving what I wanted. But generally, all the pressure is self-imposed. Contrast that to playing on a team of 14 representing a league of 100, skating in front of a crowd of thousands. Now all of a sudden it&#8217;s not a personal success or failure.

Sure, the success part is amazing! But when things go the other way, I&#8217;ve found I feel that not only did I let myself down (and heaven knows I like to beat myself up over that enough as it is), but I disappointed others as well.

That is really one thing that&#8217;s been so strange for me. When I don&#8217;t run a race as well as I want, I look internally to try to do better. But with roller derby, there is (for me) some weird sense of obligation to include leaguemates and fans into the mix as well. I learned my lesson: once I posted about how I did in a game and was told I was being selfish for not giving enough kudos to my teammates. So now my athletic performance is all wrapped up in how it&#8217;s being perceived by others. And that&#8217;s when I do well! No wonder not doing well and disappointing people is really messing with me emotionally. 

I&#8217;ve also struggled with how many fans want to talk about the game. We lost: it sucked. The more you tell me you&#8217;re disappointed, the more I feel I failed you. We&#8217;re not consoling each other, you&#8217;re making me feel responsible for your disappointment and letting me know I didn&#8217;t live up to your expectations. 

With marathoning, 99% of the people I talk to are just in awe I run; they don&#8217;t care that I ran 3:29 instead of 3:23. They wouldn&#8217;t even know the difference if I ran 4:29. This roller derby stuff is just really, really different and I&#8217;m still not sure how to handle it.
