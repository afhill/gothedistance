When my Mom and I were at the Flying Pig expo, she picked up a pair of balega socks. She really enjoyed them, and asked me to pick some up for her before I came home this week. When I was in Denver last weekend, I was in a running store and picked her up a few pairs. As I waited in line to pay, the woman in front of me mentioned that the socks SHE was purchasing were &#8220;the best running socks&#8221;. I peered over towards the counter and asked her which socks those were. Balegas! I told her that I was a smartwool girl, but I was buying balegas for my Mom. She told me that she liked smartwool for hiking, but ran in balegas. As I was already in an &#8220;[experimental sock phase](http://twitter.com/afhill262/statuses/881097524)&#8220;, I grabbed a pair for myself. 

Today I&#8217;m in Edmonton, running the 3K Family Fun Run as part of River Valley Family Festival ([Edmonton Marathon](http://www.edmontonmarathon.ca) weekend). I decided to give the balegas a try. 

<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img_0045-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="Balega socks" width="225" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-526" /> My first impression was that despite the fact they have different sizes (I went with small), the socks are a little bigger than I expected. There was plenty of room in the toebox, and when I went to put my shoes on, I actually had some extra sock bunch-up at the heel. This isn&#8217;t unusual for regular socks (aimed for size 7-9 for women), but I was disappointed since these were size small.

The socks were very cushy and comfortable, however, and I didn&#8217;t notice them being too large when running. Once finished the 3k run, I tried to assess how I felt. My feet were warm, but that could have been related to the temperature being in the high 80s! The extra room in the toebox allowed me to stretch my toes out a bit, and overall they felt pretty good.

Obviously, a 3k fun run is not a really great test, but it was enough for me to be willing to give these socks another try. I will admit that I may wait until it gets to be a bit cooler out. The style I got was the Enduro Red, which is not considered a particularly heavy sock. I can&#8217;t imagine how warm those could be!
