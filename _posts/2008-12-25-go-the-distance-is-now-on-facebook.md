For those who don&#8217;t know, I work for a marketing company, overseeing all our digital initiatives. As &#8220;social media&#8221; becomes increasingly popular, I&#8217;ve been asked about the different types of brand presence on Facebook, and the merits of each. 

To be able to speak to what&#8217;s involved, I&#8217;ve created a Facebook page of my own, associated with this blog.

My Easy-to-Remember URL: <http://www.afhill.com/facebookpage/>

Since I already have this blog, which serves as (primarily) one-way communication from me to you, the Facebook page is intended to meet another need. Not everyone is yet comfortable with RSS readers, and don&#8217;t visit blogs very often. Individuals already on Facebook will be able to read updates to this blog on that page. 

As well, Facebook pages are a great way to encourage engagement. I&#8217;ve allowed anyone who is a &#8220;fan&#8221; of the page to add photos and videos. The intent is that this is the &#8220;go the distance&#8221; blog, and that is more of the &#8220;go the distance&#8221; community. 

A Facebook page (as opposed to a Group or Cause) works well to engage with people because it sends out updates to people&#8217;s newsfeeds (&#8220;reminding&#8221; current members and helping to attract new ones). As well, you can send updates to group members via the Inbox, which can also help to encourage people to return and get involved.

Obviously, this is just an experiment, and I&#8217;m eager to see how it will go. I encourage you to [check out the Go the Distance Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Go-the-Distance/106709495133/), and become a fan!
