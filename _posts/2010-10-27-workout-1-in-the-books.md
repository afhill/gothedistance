This morning I rose early to head to the rec center for a track workout. We have a 10th of a mile track, which actually makes the math nice and easy. 

My target workout was a 10-20min warmup, then 5x.5mi @ 3:23 pace (1:30 RI), then a 10 min cooldown. I am a bit of a micromanager when it comes to pacing, so the track made it easy for me to be sure I was staying on pace. 

In order to get the timing right, I figured I needed to do each lap in 40 seconds. Since the &#8216;track&#8217; is basically a square with rounded corners, I had 10 seconds per side. Considering it&#8217;s been a LONG time since I timed myself on something like that, I did all right!

Set 1: 40, 41, 41,40, 42 (3:24)  
Set 2: 38, 39, 40, 40, 40 (3:17)  
Set 3: 38, 41, 41, 41, 39 (3:20)

So, apparently my 40 second goal was a tiny bit faster than it needed to be, but I was glad I was able to hit my overall goal. Including my warmup and cooldown, I did a total 3.8 miles (if I&#8217;d realized, I&#8217;d have made it an even 4 miles) in 33:24

A few hours later, and I feel great! Working out in the morning really does give me a better outlook on the day!
