Instead, I&#8217;m increasingly doing the &#8220;raid the fridge and throw it in a pot&#8221; game. But sometimes, the concoctions come out pretty well!

<br clear="both" /> Veggie chili:  
&#8211; one yellow pepper, diced  
&#8211; half a red onion, diced  
&#8211; garlic  
&#8211; one can fire-something tomatoes  
&#8211; half a can leftover lentils  
&#8211; can of black beans  
&#8211; veggie broth  
&#8211; rice  
&#8211; lime juice  
&#8211; spices: cumin, ancho chili pepper, peruvian lime seasoning

I sauteed the peppers and onion and then added some of the spices. Then I threw in the tomatoes, lentils, beans and broth. Added more seasonings and a bit of lime juice. Heated it to a boil, then let it simmer for about a half hour. Then added the rice. 

I was pretty impressed! The spices smelled amazing as it was cooking, but didn&#8217;t end up being overpowering. I love rice in chili!
