Today started out less than stellar, but I made it through!

I didn&#8217;t sleep great, but I got up to head to the gym for a &#8220;heavy&#8221; day for my bench press. I can&#8217;t believe the Pump and Run is in less than 3 weeks! I guzzled some Gaspari Superpump Max and got myself mentally psyched up on the way to the gym. I&#8217;m still operating on the assumption I&#8217;ll have to bench 80lbs, but I wanted to go heavy to get my body used to it so that that weight seems &#8220;light&#8221;. 

  * 10 pushups
  * bench press (at the higher weight, my left shoulder felt a bit complainy) 
      * 7x85lbs, 5x85lbs
      * 5x90lbs
      * 3x95lbs, 4x95lbs
      * 10x80lbs, 10x80lbs, 5x80lbs
      * 12x70lbs
  * 2 more sets of 10 pushups during the bench press
  * chest fly 
      * 10x15lbs
      * 7x20lbs
      * 7x25lbs
      * 4x30lbs
      * 7x25lbs
  * bench dips: 2&#215;30
  * incline bench press: 15x55lbs, 10x55lbs
  * decline bench press: 20x50lbs
  * bench press: 30x45lbs

After all that, I downed some Monster aminos and then continued to be super hungry and a bit jittery for a few hours. Still not sure how I feel about the Superpump. I both like and don&#8217;t like the energy.

Delish!! And I will admit the fact that I can just throw them in the toaster is very attractive.  
&#8211; 2 pieces of sprouted grain seed loaf with pb and hemp seed  
&#8211; butternut squash soup with sprouted grain seed loaf  
&#8211; a handful of kale chips &#8211; they ended up overdone üôÅ  
&#8211; some falafel chips and hatch-a-mole  
&#8211; tea

In addition to lifting this morning, I also met with the RRBs for another [hard Tuesday workout](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/02/the-mind-too-must-be-strong/) (9.07 miles in 1:12).

Then I headed over to AllSports for some recovery: compression boots, cold laser and then a [great session with Josh](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/02/busted-butt/)

&#8211; veggies juice: carrot, apple, ginger
