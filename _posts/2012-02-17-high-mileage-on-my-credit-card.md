Wow, not sure what it was, but this week I was a shopping fiend! And pretty well everything was health/running related..

I finally reordered some [Extreme Endurance](http://xendurance.com/). I started using this supplement back in October, and I [heartily believe](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/12/my-secret-weapon/) it has had an impact on my running. Although the recommended dosage is 6 per day, I only took 1 or 2, so a single bottle lasted me several months. The coupon code &#8220;PLANET&#8221; offers a 10% discount&#8230; 

I also went ahead and ordered some [topical magnesium oil](http://www.magneticclay.com/store/magnesium-oil-ancient-minerals-8.aspx) after hearing about it so frequently on the [Ben Greenfield Fitness](http://www.bengreenfieldfitness.com/2009/08/podcast-episode-54-the-magnesium-miracle/) podcast. I remember back in college when I went to a homeopath and he did some iridology and then asked about my chocolate cravings. At the time, yes, I was eating at least a chocolate bar a day. He said my body was having trouble absorbing calcium and I should take a magnesium supplement. I did, and the cravings went away. Lately I haven&#8217;t been taking a calc/mag because I understand that it competes with iron supplements for absorption. Not that this replaces taking a supplement, but it just seems like good stuff.

Sometimes, the music at the gym is really, really bad. But as I&#8217;ve been working more on my bench press, I can&#8217;t use my &#8220;behind the head&#8221; crappy headphones. At the Houston expo, Big Jelly tried (and bought) some [yurbuds](http://www.yurbuds.com/), which come in a number of sizes and &#8220;twist-lock&#8221; to stay in. I&#8217;d been thinking about them a bit, and at the Boulder Running Company they even have a little ear measuring tool to ensure you get the right size (I got the smallest, which honestly I probably didn&#8217;t need to be measured for). Also got to use my RRB discount, score!

And then&#8230;

There was the 40% off sale at all winter apparel at Runner&#8217;s Roost. 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hoodie-2.png" alt="" title="hoodie" width="215" height="215" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3703" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hoodie-2.png)  
I had to stop by there anyway to pick up a shirt from my race a few weeks ago. I&#8217;d been looking at replacing the jacket I&#8217;d had stolen the other week, so I was already receptive to some winter apparel shopping and the sale was just a good excuse. Quite a few of the women in my running club have the same Nike jacket (all in yellow!), but there were none left in my size so I&#8217;ll have to be unique ðŸ˜‰ I found this great [Utopia Thermal Hoodie](http://www.brooksrunning.com/Utopia-Thermal-Hoodie/220304,default,pd.html) from Brooks, which is actually WAY more comfortable than my old jacket. 

I also came across a great vest as well. I really debated on this one, it wasn&#8217;t in the plan to buy a vest. But it was really comfortable and as it is, I often end up rolling up my sleeves when I run anyway. I did a quick buddy check:

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/buddycheck.png" alt="" title="buddycheck" width="286" height="224" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3704" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/buddycheck.png)

Decision made! And honestly, I&#8217;m so glad I did. I wore it tonight, and it&#8217;s great! A bit longer so you don&#8217;t get that chill of wind between shirt and pants, and the collar is nice and high without being restricting, and it has a nice reflective pattern for running in the dark. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get a ton of wear from it! Sadly, I can&#8217;t find a photo of it online anywhere (?!?!)

I also scheduled a 30/30 appointment with Josh Shadle at Tri-Massage/AllSports Recovery. That&#8217;s 30 minutes of deep tissue/sports massage, and 30 minutes of [muscle restoration](http://www.tri-massage.com/muscle-restoration). I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be great and horrific at the same time&#8230; Josh is the only muscle restoration practitioner in Boulder.
