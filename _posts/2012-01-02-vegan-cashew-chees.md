So I don&#8217;t eat a lot of cheese anymore, but I&#8217;ve heard that raw cashews can make for a good alternative. With my fancy new food processor, I decided to try making some. 

I found a pretty basic &#8220;[Raw Cashew Cheeze](http://vegweb.com/index.php?topic=26259.0)&#8221; recipe on Vegweb and then incorporated some of the comments. It&#8217;s remarkably easy &#8211; 

1 1/2 cups cashews (not salted, not roasted)  
1/2 to 1 cup water  
1 clove garlic, finely minced  
sprinkle of sea salt  
nutritional yeast  
lemon juice

I put in some spices too but now I don&#8217;t remember what üôÅ sage perhaps?

You soak the cashews for a couple hours, then blend it all together, and then let it sit in a cool place for 24 hours. Seriously, delicious. Obviously not low-fat, but I don&#8217;t care about those things! üôÇ
