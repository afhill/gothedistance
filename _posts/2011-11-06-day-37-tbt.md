Food (inc. Cheat meal)  
&#8211; [Santiago&#8217;s breakfast burrito](http://eatatsantiagos.com/). These seem to be a Denver classic. At only $2 each, I ordered two, one with cheese and one without. The cheese one was incredibly greasy and unappetizing-looking, so I tried the other. Pretty good!  
&#8211; Reese&#8217;s peanut butter cup  
&#8211; several samples of my [first batch of homemade kombucha](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/11/my-first-batch-of-kombucha-tea/)  
&#8211; dulse and tomato sandwich on whole wheat bread  
&#8211; clif bar  
&#8211; [homemade energy gel](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/10/energy-gel/)  
&#8211; EAS high-protein shake  
&#8211; homemade [vegan pho](http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/soup/recipe-vegetarian-pho-107312). Yum! The only bad part was the sriracha sauce- it has sugar. I used bean thread noodles instead of the traditional rice noodles.  
&#8211; coconut water

Exercise  
&#8211; [18 miles in 2:29](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/11/18-in-the-bank/). The last few miles weren&#8217;t fun, but they were the fastest ones!
