Finished out my last run of 2009 with [new orthotics](http://www.footlevelers.com/products/orthotics_ultra.php), [new shoes](http://www.brooksrunning.com/product/1200581B/Ravenna) and [new tights](http://www.cw-x.com/ExploreProducts.aspx?product=tights&by=activity&gender=womens). I did a short run just to get out there, and I did stop my watch to walk over icy patches. The local 3 mile loop around the neighbourhood (that includes a couple nice hills): 21:06. Nice!

I also found out that the Boulder Running Company by my office does runs out of their store on Saturday mornings. Guess where I&#8217;ll be this weekend?
