By race founder Rudy Fahl:

There&#8217;s no thrill in easy sailing  
When the skies are clear and blue;  
No joy in merely doing things  
Which most anyone can do.

But, there is some satisfaction  
Which is mighty sweet to take;  
When you reach the top of Pikes Peak  
That you thought you could not make.
