&#8211; 13.1 miles of awesomeness

Food:  
&#8211; almond butter and honey on Ezekiel bread  
&#8211; 2 bananas  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; G2 gatorade  
&#8211; half a GU  
&#8211; clif bar  
&#8211; breakfast spring roll (with unacceptable rice noodles)  
&#8211; small evol veggie burrito  
&#8211; hummus (with unacceptable pita)  
&#8211; honeymilk

&#8211; nectarine  
&#8211; coconut water  
&#8211; riceless burrito &#8211; lettuce, black beans, pico, corn salsa, guac in a whole wheat tortilla

There were a few failings on the food today. I should have planned better for post-race nutrition, but I wanted to be sure I did take in some calories for recovery.
