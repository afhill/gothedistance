So my friend&#8217;s ex Drema emailed me the other day. She is in Iraq, coming back in August or so. She recently started marathon training, with her goal race being in West Virginia in November. I know I looked at that race last year,so when she emailed me to tell me she&#8217;d started training, I said that I may be tempted to run it as well. I&#8217;m excited for her working towards her first marathon, and pretty impressed at her dedication, she said it was over 100F the other day when she went to run! West Virginia in November will be MUCH easier conditions! 

Today she actually asked if I would run the race WITH her. That could be alot of fun: I enjoyed Columbus last year with Sarah and it would be so great to run her first marathon with her! Naturally, November is a fair ways off but I&#8217;m happy she&#8217;s excited and working towards this goal!
