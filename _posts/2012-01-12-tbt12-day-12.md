Three hours after my last blog post I was up checking my work email to be sure everything was good with the site launch last night.No major fires, but I did start working right away and the day has gone from here..

I woke up SO congested I couldn&#8217;t breathe through my nose at all! No good! So I looked up natural remedies and found this scary elixir of apple cider vinegar, oil of oregano and garlic in warm water. Seriously, it made my eyes water just breathing in the steam! Once it cooled off I did drink the craziness and now by the end of the day my nose is running like a faucet. Progress, I guess!

I didn&#8217;t feel great today but I really didn&#8217;t feel near as poorly as I expected given my lack of sleep. Around 4pm I even realized I hadn&#8217;t even had tea today! I&#8217;m proud of the ole body for not thinking I need sugar or caffeine to function properly.

#### Food (Cheat day)

-toast with peanut butter and hemp seed. sourdough bread &#8211; I need to use it up!  
&#8211; crazy elixir of apple cider vinegar, oil of oregano and garlic &#8211; 3x!!!  
&#8211; bean and guacamole tostada  
&#8211; tofu with [peanut ginger sauce](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/tofu_with_peanut_ginger_sauce.html), mushrooms, spinach and brown rice  
&#8211; vegetarian combo platter at [Abyssinia Market Cafe (Ethiopian )](http://www.yelp.com/biz/abyssinia-market-cafe-ethiopian-restaurant-denver)  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; small piece of dark chocolate.  
&#8211; emergen-c  
&#8211; warm almond milk with turmeric and ginger

I had a $25 groupon to use before the end of the month, so KJ and I went for dinner. The veggie combo was only $10 so I even ordered tea to try to bring the bill to $25 &#8211; no luck! I guess this is where drinking comes in handy, in running a bill up. 

#### Exercise

Nice 3.3 miler around the hood. It felt good to be running, although it was a little slick out. Not terribly &#8220;intensive&#8221; but that&#8217;s what&#8217;s gotta happen when you&#8217;re trying not to be sick for a big race (pretty sure Sunday&#8217;s intensity will account for a few days&#8217; worth!)
