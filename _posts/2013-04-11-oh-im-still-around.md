I&#8217;ve been ignoring the ole blog lately, but I&#8217;m around. Of course, I can only go so long without a random new obsession (see: roller derby, crossfit). The latest? ROCK CLIMBING! Or, Bouldering since I live in Boulder.

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/906877_10151353388850079_1115938007_o-225x300.jpg" alt="Climbing in Panama" width="225" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4476" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/906877_10151353388850079_1115938007_o.jpg)It started innocently.. I went to Panama on vacation and a friend and I jumped in on a [last-minute excursion](http://boqueteoutdooradventures.com/climb.html). We were the only two who were to be guided by pro climber [Cesar Augusto Melendez Castillo](http://cesaraugustomelendez.blogspot.com/). We had an absolute blast and both of us decided then and there that we had to continue to pursue this when we got back home.

Now, I sorta knew I&#8217;d love it, and have been talking about getting into climbing for awhile. I even had a [rock climbing daily deal](http://www.denverdailydeals.com/deal/denver/apex-adventure-59-rock-climbing-49-100-credit-backpack-trip-1) I bought last year but never redeemed. But now that I&#8217;d had a taste, I knew I wanted to get into it.

You know, with all my spare time.. after work, school, running and a renewed dedication to meditation and yoga&#8230;

Now I figured it can&#8217;t be that easy to get into rock climbing. There&#8217;s all that hassle of finding a partner you trust with your life, identifying routes, tying knots&#8230; I had the desire but I wasn&#8217;t sure about all that effort. Lucky (?) for me, I live in Boulder. Home of bouldering.

Totally egotistical moment here, I love my back in this pic. I feel like I&#8217;m meant to be a climber! Ok &#8211; back to the story.

What is bouldering, you may ask? Well.. it&#8217;s climbing on boulders. No ropes, no harness. You have a crash pad beneath you. Some folks actually do this outside, but there here in town there is actually a [bouldering gym (the Spot)](http://www.thespotgym.com) where you can just go in and climb when you want. I love this idea! Even if I first was enamored by the idea of climbing in the great outdoors, this seems a great way to hone your skills. AND my roommate Josh is a member at the Spot, and he gets two guest passes a month! I wasted no time in inviting myself along ðŸ™‚ 

I&#8217;m so sure I&#8217;m going to like this new sport I bought my own climbing shoes and we went to the Spot on Sunday. It was cool to watch some of the more experienced climbers &#8211; it was really beautiful and graceful how they swung from hold to hold. Personally, I was pretty limited in what I was able to do (or willing to try) but I guess that&#8217;s the point, right? ðŸ™‚

I snapped up another outdoor climbing daily deal as well and I really want to keep this up when I can. I so love the outdoors, and this is freaking Colorado. I want to take advantage!

So yes, still running but of course I can&#8217;t be faithful to one sport..
