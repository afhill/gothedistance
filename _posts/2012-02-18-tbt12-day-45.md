What a great day! I was dragging this morning as I headed to Boulder (although I was happy to have cheese with my toast and pb this morning!), but had a good hard workout. Then we all went for coffee, where I ordered the worlds largest chai, a veggie breggo (weird stuffed sandwich they heated on a panini press), and a chocolate croissant for later. Then a few of us went to Recovery, and those compression boots have never felt so good!! Maybe because we&#8217;d just done a good hard workout?? I did the inversion table, cold laser on my hip and the roller. Stopped at the gym for my high rep bench press (did 25&#215;65, 20&#215;60 &#8211; disappointed I didn&#8217;t get my 30 but it was a hard day) and some abs. A few blocks from home, I saw my friends Joe and Vicky strolling down the street with some friends. I waved and soon after got a text saying they were walking to lunch and did I want to join. So I threw on some clean clothes and headed out. We ended up at Root Down which is totally amazingly delicious.. And has bottomless mimosas. I got the mushroom omelette and had a few bites of their oatmeal (which has quinoa, almonds, Devonshire cream and warmed rhubarb and strawberries). We wandered into a funky antique shop where I found a treasure/gift for someone. I&#8217;m sooo excited to give it to them (I don&#8217;t think they read this, but just in case ðŸ˜‰ ). We wandered a bit more, down to the Mexican bakery where I got a cookie and then to menchies for froyo. Yeah, I do cheat days right! By this time we&#8217;d wandered a good ways from my house and it was starting to get chilly (especially eating frozen yogurt with no jacket) so we headed our separate ways. I&#8217;d been saying earlier I&#8217;d had no plans for the day, so how perfect to see them and have a nice relaxing day. They invited me for games night later but it had been 11 hrs since I&#8217;d really been home and I&#8217;m doing a long run tomorrow, so I relaxed instead. 

I&#8217;m so thankful this is a long weekend!!
