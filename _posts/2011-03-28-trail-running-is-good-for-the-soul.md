Or at least, _my_ soul. 

I haven&#8217;t run much since I learned I had a tear in my PCL, but decided I needed to give it a try. I went nice and slow and while I felt initially I was favoring my right side, after awhile my confidence grew. 

I ran a series of trails, which is always fun. I like the uneven terrain, which engages the mind as well as the body. I actually wished I had a voice recorder with me as I ran, as I composed what I wanted to be this post in my head. 

Trail running is good for wanderers. Every path is another adventure, something new to explore. Even with tired legs, I can&#8217;t resist heading off to see where another offshoot path will lead. There is something liberating at every juncture, the decision made to keep going further, always knowing you can turn and retreat at any time. There is a certain power that comes from making that ongoing decision to extend the run.

Running engages my mind as well as my body, which is just what I need. Just as they talk about doing rote tasks to tap into another part of the brain, running lets me connect with my thoughts in a different way. I don&#8217;t always remember what I think about (it&#8217;s difficult now to recall how I wanted to try to verbalize this very sentiment) but it&#8217;s nearly always a positive, empowering experience. 

On Saturday I took it nice and slow, and after an hour started getting a bit tired and hungry. But there was a path, how could I resist? I had no goals for time or distance, just a yearning to run.

I also embrace the pace of trail running. There are some merits in road races and running for speed. From a training perspective, it&#8217;s great to be pushing hard and realizing gains. But that also adds pressure. Trail running (at least when I do it) is purely recreational. It&#8217;s not a way to conquer nature, but a way to commune with it. I feel small in a large world when I run trails, in a very safe way. I feel that I am part of a larger system. 

In that 8.5 mile run, all was well with the world. And the endorphins kept pumping long afterwards.
