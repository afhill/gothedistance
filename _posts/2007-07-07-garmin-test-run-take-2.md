My first group run with the garmin. Funny, these are the guys who scoffed a few years ago when I wanted an HRM. Today less than every half mile &#8220;how fast are we going?&#8221; &#8220;is that 4.5 miles?&#8221; &#8220;we&#8217;re speeding up, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221; Ha! 

I think I&#8217;m going pretty well at not over-focussing on the watch while running. Sure, I&#8217;d check it out as I was going and I did have the distance alert every half mile, but I don&#8217;t know that we really changed our pace according to what we saw (we just said &#8220;whoa, 8:15 is too fast&#8221;, and kept going at the same pace!)

I still need to figure out what to display: today I had elapsed distance, elapsed time, hr and pace. The thing is, the trail is marked with half and mile markers, so I probably didn&#8217;t NEED to display that (although we knew EXACTLY how far off course we went for a water stop!). I may rather have access to the average pace.. eliminate that math in my head ðŸ™‚

Stats: (I want to figure out a way to export these individually!)
