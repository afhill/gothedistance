_VO2 max 10 mi w/ 4 x 1,200 m @ 5K race pace (7:04); jog 2 min between_  
400m: 1:45  
1,200m: 5:17

Well I got the speed in there, but I extended the intervals, so I&#8217;m not sure the workout was effective as it could have been :-/

~3.1 cool-down: 28:58

I stopped for a breather and water after the second repeat, and when I was 45 sec into the fourth repeat my leg started to hurt a little, so I stopped, caught my breath and walked back to my starting area and did the whole repeat. 

It&#8217;s interesting, 5K pace doesn&#8217;t seem that hard anymore. It&#8217;s not &#8220;comfortable&#8221; but it&#8217;s sustainable. I think I have it under control more than when I have been trying to race the distance, when I go out too hard and crash.

Oh, but even if I say it&#8217;s not too tough, I was hurtin on the way back home.. I definitely had the marathoner shuffle going on.
