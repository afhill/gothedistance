Yes, I&#8217;m starting up again. Since finishing my first round of Total Body Transformation, I&#8217;ve continued to eat pretty well. But lately I&#8217;ve been letting things slide. I haven&#8217;t skated in several weeks, and haven&#8217;t had the same enthusiasm for the gym. Some of the other gals are restarting, so I decided to join them.

Started off well: I went to the gym and two trainers basically cornered me and said they&#8217;d work with me. Box jumps, squats, pushups, stability exercises- it was a good workout! They said they think I set a record for a bosu squat, and most guys never made it through as far as I did (they actually sorta gave up on me and asked me to do a one-armed pushup. I started but couldn&#8217;t. ). Great encouragement that I still have some of that strength. 

I&#8217;m still in a weird place, goal-wise. For running, being light is good. But I want to be physically strong and ripped. 

Food:  
-Green smoothie: spinach, flax seed, hemp protein, egg whites, hemp milk, orange, chia seed, creatine, bcaas  
-Honeymilk post-workout
