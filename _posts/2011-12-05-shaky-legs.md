This week I&#8217;ll be at a retreat center with a few hiking trails, so I&#8217;m hoping to get a few runs in. However, there&#8217;s no fitness center so I decided I should hit the gym while I can and try to do some strength training. 

The other day I came across a [picture of me from March](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20110319-1032031.jpg), and I have to say my arms looked WAY better than they do now. I&#8217;m pretty sure this running stuff is not helping me keep muscle mass, but I&#8217;m also admittedly not hitting the weights like I was in the Spring. 

Notably, because I&#8217;ve been upping my mileage, I haven&#8217;t worked my legs hard. I figured since I likely won&#8217;t run tomorrow (it&#8217;s a travel day), today was a good day for it!

  * lunges and squats holding 25lb dumbells
  * Squat machine &#8211; 3x(5x)200lbs
  * Leg press 10x(180, 250) 5x(300, 260) 10x(200)
  * 1 min mountain climbers (137)
  * Single leg squats with rear leg on bench
  * Hamstring curls 10x(30, 40) 5&#215;50, 10x(40, 30). This was a big deal &#8211; I&#8217;m not a fan of hamstring curls. I think this is the best I&#8217;ve ever done!
  * 1 min bootstrappers (42?)
  * Leg extension 3x(5&#215;105), (10&#215;75), (10&#215;45) &#8211; This was really disappointing. In the Spring I&#8217;d start at 135lbs. I felt a bit of strain in my calf &#8211; I blame the hamstring curls. I don&#8217;t even know if that makes sense, but work with me&#8230;
  * 45degree Donkey calf 10x(120,135,150) 7&#215;165
  * 1 min skater jumps (68)
  * And just to completely finish off my legs&#8230; 3x(1min potty squat)

And because it&#8217;s 3F in Denver, then I had to pull on warmup pants to go outside. My legs weren&#8217;t really cooperating in that!

Actually before I started my left knee was feeling a bit \*something\* but by the end of the workout it had worked its way out and felt great! (it was the rest of my legs that were complaining at me) I was glad I did the workout to get things feeling good again. I really do think I need to spend a bit more time stretching and foam rolling, however.
