See, I should never crow about &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like I need a cheat day&#8221; because we all know what happens next.. I took today as a cheat day. We went to [Denver Urban Homesteading](http://www.denverurbanhomesteading.com/) to check out the arepas Queen raves about, and first wandered around. I told my Dad to go ahead and try the organic bliss ice cream and was going to resist, and then decided what the heck. So I enjoyed a variety of delicious samples: samosas, empanadas, coconut ice cream and goat cheese. Then later on the way home I saw an A&W, and decided to swing in. Root beer reminds me of my Dad so I thought I&#8217;d be a nice treat. But the first sip, I was put off by the carbonation. Then the sugar hit me. All in all I didn&#8217;t really enjoy it and it didn&#8217;t taste like I remembered it üôÅ

#### Food

  * Pb chickpea bar
  * Smoothie: egg whites, kefir, spinach, orange, frozen berries, chia seeds, wheat germ, protein powder. 
  * Protein pancakes
  * [Billy&#8217;s Infinity Greens](http://www.billys-superfoods.com/) bar
  * Samples at DUH: ice cream, goats milk cheese, blackberry pie, chard and cheese empanada, samosas (spinach, potato, coconut). Cracker spreads: lemon and fava bean
  * [Vegan arepa](http://www.quieroarepas.com/): black beans, plantain, avocado
  * A&w root beer. 
  * [Homemade hemp hummus](http://www.foodmatters.tv/_webapp_301817/Hemp_Hummus_Recipe) with carrots. My first hummus attempt, not bad!
  * Red wine
  * Salmon (marinated in olive oil and lemon juice, with garlic, green onion, sage and fresh ginger), quinoa, spinach saut√©ed in fresh oj
  * ghiradelli sea salt soir√©e dark chocolate (from my work trip a month ago)
  * frozen yogurt with cheesecake chunks, fruit, pb chips and reese&#8217;s pb/chocolate

#### Exercise

  * 8 mile run in 1:11:48. (Average pace: 8:59, Average heart rate: 149, max heart rate 165). I track my heart rate, though I don&#8217;t generally train by it. When I did pay a bit more attention, 153 was my &#8216;recovery threshold&#8217;. I remember in Ohio when to keep my heart rate below 153, I&#8217;d have to run an 11 min mile (or slower). Today I didn&#8217;t even pay attention to my heart rate as I ran, I just ran at an easy pace. And it turns out, it was below that threshold, yet I averaged just less than a 9 minute mile. That&#8217;s great to know and see as I get back into running. Today&#8217;s 8 miles brought me to 16 for the week, which is nothing too spectacular but I&#8217;m glad to see that the quality thus far seems good. 
  * p.s. that was the longest bulleted entry ever
