This weekend I went with our B-team Bruising Altitude to Seattle to play against the Rat City B-Team, Rain of Terror. It was a huge deal for Bruising, their first out of state trip!

I had mixed feelings going into the game. This has been a rough year for me. Diagnosed with hip bursitis in mid-January, I came back just in time to play at the Wild West Showdown tournament March 4-6 with our All Star team. I made it through the three games, but it was actually after playing the Rat City All-Stars on Saturday that I felt a twinge of something in my right knee. A few days later I fell on it hard, and after a few doc visits and a $500 MRI, it was determined I had a slight PCL tear. 

I was back on skates April 4th, and only back to full contact on April 10th. I skated hard on the 10th and 12th, and felt fine. I was a bit tired and off at scrimmage on the 13th, but I went down on my knee and it was ok. My biggest concern wasn&#8217;t reinjury, but really endurance. And of course that tiny nagging voice reminding me I really haven&#8217;t been practicing roller derby for most of the year&#8230;

Along came Saturday, and for a brief moment in the warmup I thought my knee felt a little off, but nothing came of it. I felt all right, although I struggled in the second half. When I did clear the pack I felt fast, but my lateral movement was lacking and I had a weird brainfart at one point where I called it off as soon as I got lead, even though the other jammer was nowhere near clearing the pack on her first pass.

</div>Still, we made it through triumphant, I suffered no reinjury and now I have the confidence and motivation to get back to it! Which is good timing, as the All Stars have two big games coming up in the next few weeks: Philly on April 30th and Rose City on May 8th. Both teams are ranked in the Top 10 nationally, so I definitely don&#8217;t want to have any lack of confidence there (provided I&#8217;m rostered, of course). The challenge for me will of course be to balance my running, lifting and derby, and staying healthy. I really want to be sure my sports are complementing each other and not making me more susceptible to injury. I believe working with my trainer will help with that too.
