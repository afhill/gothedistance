Work is busy and I&#8217;m headachy from staring at a computer screen. Also my throat started hurting again. Ugh! Taper madness??

I haven&#8217;t had a real cheat day yet and tonight I started craving nachos! I actually looked up the menus of a few places close to my house to see if anyone had them. No one did (what&#8217;s wrong with these places???) but I&#8217;m sorta glad. My salad was way better for me. 

My run today was great, I&#8217;m so excited for the weekend! 

I should probably consider the sesame tofu a cheat, because there&#8217;s no way its so sweet and delicious without sweeteners.
