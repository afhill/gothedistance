Last week, my friend Eddie asked if I&#8217;d be willing to crew/dogsit for him as he ran the [Leadville Silver Rush 50](http://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/page/show/312299-silver-rush-50-run). As the Barr Trail Mountain Race I&#8217;d been planning to run was cancelled, I had no plans for the weekend so I was happy to help him out. 

Crewing isn&#8217;t the same as pacing; there are a few stops during the course where you can support your runner. (You drive from stop to stop) These were at mile 13.5, mile 24.5 and mile 34.5. A lot can happen over a 50 mile run, so I had food, water and clothing options at the ready. 

We headed up to Leadville on Saturday and got the chance to see the winners of the Silver Run MTB race come in. The leader set a crazy course record! It was actually fun to be in that race environment without worrying about having to prepare to compete, I thought I&#8217;d have felt some pangs of jealousy, but I was definitely ok being on the support side! 

We drove around to check out where I&#8217;d have to go the next day, so I felt prepared for my duties. We grabbed a snack rather than a great lunch, and wandered the town a bit before heading back to the hotel to relax. I was curious when we&#8217;d head out for dinner and at about 9pm Eddie said he was going to have a pop tart! Wha??? I chided him a bit that that wasn&#8217;t how you fuel the night before a race, and I think guilted him into going out by saying I was hungry and wanted to eat. We went back to the Tennessee Pass where I&#8217;d been with the girls two weeks before, and he cleaned his plate so I was glad I pushed him a bit. I consider it part of my crewing duties ðŸ™‚

The course was&#8230; interesting. Some people actually say that the marathon is harder, but I think they both have a big mental component to them. This one starts at the base of a ski hill, and the first male and female to reach the top get guaranteed entry into the Leadville 100. Way to start things off intense! Obviously there is some strategy here, as going out too fast and going anaerobic is probably not the smartest thing to do at the start of a 50 mile race&#8230; Then although the course doesn&#8217;t go as high as the marathon, it crests 12,000ft 4 times!

We were up early for the 6am start, and after watching the runners take off, I headed back to the hotel for a bit. I had a nice conversation with a older fellow named Fred, who was crewing for his wife. Apparently he used to be a runner and then one day she said &#8220;I think I can do this&#8221; and now she&#8217;s out there kicking butt! He was the one who shared with me the underground meaning of CREW &#8211; Cranky Runner, Endless Waiting. ðŸ™‚ 

Eddie was expecting to run around 10 hours, so I knew I had a good 2.5 hours until he&#8217;d be at the first aid station, but I didn&#8217;t want to risk being late so I headed up there shortly. It was actually fun to chat with other supporters and cheer on the runners. I had thought I&#8217;d be bored between stations and packed my school textbook to read (along with some more entertaining stuff) but it was tough to concentrate with everything going on. 

It was the first time I&#8217;d officially crewed, but I&#8217;ve run enough races (albeit shorter) to know that it&#8217;s good to have a plan. I asked Eddie in advance what he thought he may want at each station, and then had extra things at the ready as well. 

I was actually surprised by how many people I knew in the race. At the first station, Sean Wetstine, Amy Schneider and Eddie all came by within 9 minutes of each other. I&#8217;d cheer folks on by name as they ran past, and then I heard another spectator ask &#8220;are their names on their bibs?&#8221; Nope, I actually knew them!

I stopped a bit in town and walked around between the stops. It was a good day weather-wise, not too hot. At the second stop, Eddie was looking a little worse for wear. He said that nothing particularly hurt, but things weren&#8217;t clicking, either. I encouraged him as best I could; he was there to finish, not to set any records. He is training for the Leadville 100 in August and this was a big mental checkpoint for him to see how he was doing in preparation. At this aid station I gave him a red bull and he grabbed some sandwiches from the volunteers. He stopped to talk as he ate, but I encouraged him to keep moving so I walked a bit with him. After he finished his drink and could take his water bottle back from me, I turned around and ran back to the car. Some poor runner joked that he hoped no photographers were around to see him get passed by a girl in jeans! I laughed and assured him I was only running a tenth of a mile!

Although I&#8217;d packed plenty of snacks for myself for the day (nuts, hummus and multiseed crackers, cherries, cut veggies, a probar), I took the time to stop for a nice big spinach salad for lunch. I can see how easily a supporter could forget to fuel themselves if they were focused on their runner, but I figured there was no need for me to sacrifice my own nutrition.

At the last aid station where I could support Eddie, he was definitely feeling the effects of the distance. We filled his water bottle with coconut water and he doused his head with water, then slowly set on his way. I tried to be upbeat but not annoying; telling him he was on his way home and the next time I saw him, they&#8217;d be putting a medal around his neck. 

I had wondered why Eddie wanted me to bring water to fill his bottle as we were right next to official aid stations. But once I saw the line of people waiting to fill their bottles and camelbaks, I understood. It&#8217;s not that a few minutes waiting will make or break your race, but it&#8217;s always tougher to get started again after a stop like that. It was my goal at the stops to keep him moving forward, not taking too long at the stops. 

Then it was off to the finish! It was fun to see folks come in. The first female was a 21 year old who&#8217;d never done a 50 miler before. How impressive! People I&#8217;d met through the day had their runners come in and it was great to congratulate them. A few runners that Eddie had been close to came in around the 9 hour mark, and I knew I had a ways to wait. At almost exactly the 10 hour mark, the sky opened up and it poured! Spectators rushed under the tents to wait for our poor runners out there in the downpour. It even hailed for a bit!

    Happy to be done!

</div>I will admit that I started to get nervous about Eddie, but then all of a sudden Eddie, Phil from Runners Roost and Abby (Dan Verdi&#8217;s wife) all came in within a matter of minutes! Eddie crossed the line and put his hands on his knees. His friend Carrie (who I&#8217;d heard of during the race and met afterwards) and I went to him with a sweatshirt and rain poncho. He joined us under the tent where we had him strip off his wet shirt and put on the sweatshirt, and change his shoes (he didn&#8217;t have flipflops- ALL RACERS SHOULD HAVE FLIPFLOPS AT THE READY). He didn&#8217;t look great, but honestly, no one SHOULD look great after 50 miles. After a bit he perked up a bit, although he wasn&#8217;t interested in eating anything. Eventually he asked if I was ready to head back to Boulder. (Many folks stayed the night in Leadville but I had to work the next day). He said we&#8217;d stop for food on the way back. 

Sadly, traffic was horrendous and it took close to 4 hours to get back (to compare, it took 2 hours to get there). We stopped at Georgetown for Subway, and was told they were out of bread! Eddie got a strawberry milk (no comment&#8230; ) and we forged ahead. I wanted to stop at the next stop to get him something but he declined. Finally I got him to have some of the remaining mixed nuts I had. 

Eventually we made it home, and in a sweet gesture, Eddie gave me his finishers bracelet from the race. He said he already had one from last year, and guys don&#8217;t really need bracelets anyway, and if I hadn&#8217;t been there to look after his dog and crew, he wouldn&#8217;t have gone to the race at all. I was very grateful and it&#8217;s now proudly on my shelf, although I also think this means one day I WILL have to run the race for it to be legit.

In all, it was a really fun weekend and I was glad I helped. But I had no idea crewing would be so tiring! I wanted to be sure I was there for my runner and anticipating his needs. 

I also know it was more enjoyable because of how laid back Eddie was. Even when he was asking for things, he was always really polite (I can get snappy when I&#8217;m tired/hungry/whatever). He certainly didn&#8217;t live up to the cranky runner persona Fred had told me to cheerily expect. 

Helping out at the race helped me feel more connected with the running community and I&#8217;d certainly consider helping out in other ways as well. AND it made me SUPER excited for this weekend&#8217;s relay! There were a few things I made note of (make sure you have a towel, not JUST dry clothes in case of poor weather, and plastic bags to store stuff in). I can&#8217;t believe I have another full weekend dedicated to running in just a couple days! I feel really fortunate right now to have so many opportunities to feed my passion.
