The first time I heard about roller derby (back in Ohio, a few years back), I was really interested, but I was worried about injury. Then I saw a game, and it didn&#8217;t appear as aggressive as I had thought. I started seriously considering it.. until I heard that one of the pieces of necessary equipment was a mouthguard. 

I don&#8217;t know what it was specifically about the idea of a mouthguard that scared me, but it did! Upon reflection, I think it could be because I&#8217;ve never had one before: even playing ice hockey in college with full pads, we didn&#8217;t have mouthguards. It was the idea that one may be needed that concerned me: it was <a href="http://safetygirl411.blogspot.com/2008/12/its-not-mouthguard-its-what-mouthguard.html" rel="nofollow">what the mouthguard represents</a>!

Once I moved to Colorado and embarked on the adventure of getting to meet people, I revisited the idea of roller derby. It was a different athletic activity, and I&#8217;d be meeting some different people and keeping myself busy. 

[As I mentioned](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/01/trying-out-for-roller-derby/), I made the league, and now I have the fun of equipping myself:

  </p>
</div>

There were no helmets that fit, so that&#8217;s still outstanding from a safety perspective. I also just ordered my skates!

  </p>
</div>

I ordered this basic-level skate, but upgraded to speed wheels. I had the important decision of what color wheels to get, between baby blue, light pink, and red. I went for red.

Yowza! After literally years of musing about derby, it&#8217;s hard to believe I&#8217;ll actually start practices in two weeks!
