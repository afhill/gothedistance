Counting off accountability posts was getting boring, but that&#8217;s basically what this is ðŸ™‚

This morning I met Cheri, Annie, Rick and Laura for a midweek run. According to my target mileage (45-55) and the [suggested mileage Jay has set out](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqC6sMNh4mJOdHlnZnBkVzFfd0xSVHRYV2hTUHhER3c), I should have probably done around 8 or 9 miles, but the gang wanted to do 10 so I went along with them. (Annie had run 4 before meeting us). It was a good run, and we chatted about how our meetings with Jay had gone. I&#8217;d been hoping Cheri was considering a fall marathon, since Rick and Laura don&#8217;t run that distance and I was looking for a training buddy. I think it&#8217;s pretty funny that these folks do 60mpw without a marathon goal &#8211; I&#8217;ve barely ever crested that high of mileage even with my marathons! We talked about target races, Cheri and Annie are both considering [Rock n Roll New Orleans](http://runrocknroll.competitor.com/new-orleans) but are unsure about timing. The race is in February! Surprised, I asked how long they generally trained for a half, and Cheri said she felt like she trained all summer for Columbus (i.e., 6 months).

Huh.

So, higher mileage than me, and some serious dedicated training for months. Maybe there is a reason I&#8217;m not meeting my goals and can&#8217;t hang with the other members of my club..

It definitely gave me something to think about. I know I felt burnt out from training this summer, but maybe having a stronger base would be helpful. Definitely something to consider. 

In all, we ran 10 miles in about 1:22. As we went our separate ways they asked if I wanted to meet up in the morning, but I&#8217;m taking my day off tomorrow! And I&#8217;ll enjoy it! ðŸ™‚
