I didn&#8217;t take the time to post, but yesterday&#8217;s date sat well with me. The Steamtown marathon was Oct 9, 2005. The wonderful, fabulous &#8220;Pfitz really works&#8221; PR-perfect race. I&#8217;m definitely getting excited to see what Chicago holds.

Started back at the gym on Sunday. I knew my abs had felt the impact of not working out for months, but I was amazed by how weak they were! I&#8217;m still feeling some soreness today, but it&#8217;s that good soreness! I missed the gym!
