So the race I&#8217;m currently training for is the Goofy Challenge at Disney; a half marathon on Saturday, a full on Sunday. I did what I call official goofy training this weekend: met the group yesterday and did 8/9 at Highbanks, then today I did 20 on the bikepath. 

It was a very slow 20, but I did it. I actually consider it double-duty training, as I wore my camelbak for the first 13 miles, in training for Crown King. I did two out-and-back loops of 6.5, then a last loop of 7 (minus a bit of walking). Between loops I stopped at the car, had a bit of gu and checked on Doug&#8217;s race; he was doing the Vegas Marathon today and his splits were being text messaged to me. 

Loop 1: 66 min (6.5 miles)  
Loop 2: 65 min (6.5 miles)  
Loop 3: 65 min (~7 miles)  
Total: 3:16

By the last loop I was so hungry and miserable, it was bad. I was just waiting to be done. But most importantly, I stuck through it.

Finished the week with 42 miles, almost doubling last week&#8217;s mileage (Whoops) and the most I&#8217;ve run since Steamtown.

Now if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I need to wash the sweat off and go treat myself to a chipotle burrito.
