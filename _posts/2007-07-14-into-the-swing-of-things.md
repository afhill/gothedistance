I joined the Arena District Athletic Club around the corner from work, so that I had no excuse to miss workouts, etc. It&#8217;s been a long time since I did anything at the gym.. I went to do leg extensions, and I always do them one leg at a time and I was amazed how much weaker my left is &#8212; there was a specific weak point I could pinpoint. Now I am eager to work on that, I can only assume it will help my running.

I had a good week getting back to running:  
Mon: joined gym  
Tues: .5mile warmup on the TM, gym  
Wed: 5mi before work  
Thurs: 2mi?, gym  
Fri: supposed to go out, decided to take a rest day  
Sat: one loop at Highbanks this morning, doing a one miler tonight.

I&#8217;ve also set aside time on my calendar to start going to the gym consistently. I feel so good after just a little weight/strength training!

Part of tonight is to see what my max HR is. I know I&#8217;ve seen 197 before, but I think it may be higher. Considering last week&#8217;s 10 miler I ran at an average 177 and that was a &#8216;comfortable&#8217; long run&#8230; I really don&#8217;t think running at 88% of your HRR is something you&#8217;re supposed to be able to do for 10 miles easily!
