Once you&#8217;ve earned the classification of &#8216;crazy runner&#8217;, it&#8217;s hard to shake! Today my boss was so excited to tell me about the marathon that occurs in Newport RI, where she has a second home. Apparently the [Amica Marathon](http://www.amicamarathon.com) was ranked #4 by readers of Runners&#8217; World, and the course is beautiful.

She was so excited to show me the website and we watched a video of the course, while she pointed out the highlights. She told me I should run it next year, and she&#8217;d do the 5K. Her husband (my &#8216;other boss&#8217;) said he&#8217;d do it as well if she really was willing to commit. 

So, despite the fact I&#8217;ve told myself I&#8217;m not going to run as much next year, who am I to take away the inspiration and encouragement of someone who seemingly just needs an excuse to run? (And, a trip to Rhode Island??)
