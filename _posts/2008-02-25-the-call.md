Last week, [Meredith](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/2008/02/i-hate-decisions.html) posted about a feeling in the pit of her stomach. A choice she had to make. 

All weekend I&#8217;ve had this nagging feeling about today, 2/25. Did I have something to do? No deadlines at work, no errands to run in the evening. What was it? Why was this date seared into my brain as &#8220;a day to remember&#8221;?

I just looked at RunOhio.com, and there it was. **Lottery Opens for the ING New York City Marathon 2008 &#8211; February 25, 2008**.

This past Saturday, I was talking with my friends about entering the lottery. As I mentioned it, I gave a big sigh. They asked why.. it&#8217;s hard to explain. I know I want to run this race. I feel I _need_ to. And as I get older I know my life priorities will change. As much as I&#8217;d like to qualify, I may not. Even entering the lottery, I&#8217;m not guaranteed to be selected (but being denied three years in a row guarantees you entry). 

I need to try.

_The premier event of New York Road Runners, the ING New York City Marathon is one of the world&#8217;s great road races, drawing more than 103,000 applicants. The race attracts many world-class professional athletes, not only for the more than $600,000 in prize money, but also for the chance to excel in the media capital of the world before two million cheering spectators and more than 300 million worldwide television viewers. As any one of the nearly 750,000 past participants will attest, crossing the finish line in Central Park is one of the great thrills of a lifetime. For more information, visit www.ingnycmarathon.org._
