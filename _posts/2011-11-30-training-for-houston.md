Yesterday on my run, one of my teammates asked if I was training for something specific. I said I had two marathons in January.

So after 7 years of marathons, I think it&#8217;s time to admit: there is a difference between &#8220;planning to run&#8221; and &#8220;training&#8221;. For a long time, I saw them as the same, as &#8220;training&#8221; was really about getting in the miles to ensure I could finish. Heck, sometimes I didn&#8217;t even do that (remember the Big Sur marathon, when I hadn&#8217;t run over 13 miles in the 3 months preceding the race?)

I have two races in January, yes. But I don&#8217;t plan to do anything spectacular for Disney: that&#8217;s an experiential event. I DO however want to do well in Houston. I&#8217;ve blown away so many PRs in the past 12 months, but that&#8217;s one distance I haven&#8217;t put a [serious training effort](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/10/ready-to-start-training/) toward since training for Rock n Roll AZ in [January 2009](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/01/rock-and-roll-arizona-race-report/).

Wow.. THREE years? I actually originally wrote January 2010 and had to go back and check the date.

Sure enough, a glance at my [race resume](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/race-resume/) shows a bunch of races (I count 10) since then, but I can&#8217;t honestly say I followed any sort of serious regimen to try to do well. I was running, but not training. 

The final time we all [ran Boston](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/09/a-belated-boston-marathon-race-report/) was in 2009. I hadn&#8217;t particularly trained for it, and Helen and I both ran reasonably well (~3:47). Meanwhile, Meredith ran a [BIG PR](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/2009/04/boston-marathon-2009.html) (it&#8217;s still the fastest marathon between the two of us, on any course). She&#8217;d recently started working with a coach, and was mentally and physically prepared to kick butt. I was happy for her, but she said something after the race that bothered me(apparently &#8211; it&#8217;s over 2 years later). She said something along the lines of &#8220;maybe if you and Helen ran fewer races, you&#8217;d do better&#8221;. Now, I love to run and race, so I dismissed it. At the end of that marathon, we were excitedly going over our plans for our next big race together, [Pikes Peak](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/08/pikes-peak-marathon-race-report/)! 

If I&#8217;d trained and peaked for Boston, and left it all on the course, I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;d have been emotionally ready to discuss the next big thing. But perhaps that&#8217;s why there is a difference between training for and planning to run. Pikes Peak (a lot of the races Helen and I have done over the years) is for the joy of running, not to try to achieve a particular goal. I thankfully recover quickly, so I have been able to run [multiple marathons](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2005/10/detroit-free-press-marathon-report/) back-to-back, so I think as long as I&#8217;m smart in Disney, I won&#8217;t compromise Houston. 

So, a long story to say that I&#8217;m running Disney, but I&#8217;m training for Houston. Although it&#8217;s not a huge shift, that means I am going to orient my thinking and my training a bit more towards that following weekend, and mentally prepare myself to do more than just run. Disney will be something to enjoy, but I don&#8217;t want it to detract at all from what I have in mind for January 15, 2012.

After that I have a few more races I&#8217;m planning to run, but so far I don&#8217;t have anything I&#8217;ve set sights on to really train for. I want to see what I can do now in Houston, and then be able to see how much further my training group can take me.
