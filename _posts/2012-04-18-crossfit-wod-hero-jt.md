I woke up with crazy sore glutes and legs from [yesterday&#8217;s workout](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/04/crossfit-math-is-hard/ "Crossfit: Math is Hard"), but decided to go back for more. I&#8217;d reviewed the workout and it didn&#8217;t seem too bad (and would leave my legs alone):

> 21-15-9 reps, for time
> 
>   * Handstand push-ups
>   * Ring dips
>   * Push-ups

Sigh.. when will I learn that Hero workouts are never &#8220;not too bad&#8221;?? 

There were only three of us in the class: Paul and some really hardcore guy from Chicago. Warmup included a mile run.. my legs were NOT happy!

I did the HSPU with one ab mat on a weight plate, and hooked the rings up with a band (I&#8217;d never done ring dips before). 

The coach said it was about a 15 minute workout, but there was a 25 minute cut off. What makes this one difficult is that all the exercises hit the same body part (chest/shoulders). He said it will come to a grinding halt at some point where you can&#8217;t even string together a couple reps in a row. 

He was right. 

Whoa &#8211; even by the first round of pushups I couldn&#8217;t do them unbroken. But the handstand pushups were the worst. By the second round, I realized I could rarely even do 2 in a row. I&#8217;d push up, then lower down and be unable to push back up again. He&#8217;d expressed that he wanted us to take the time we needed, rather than change our modification partway through. So for awhile I&#8217;d have to just stand there and stare at the wall before taking another attempt. More than once I&#8217;d go for a handstand and not be able to push at all! Whoa!

Thankfully the band helped a TON with the ring dips. That ended up being the easiest of the three exercises. In my head I hate those modifications but the danged handstand pushups were SO difficult I couldn&#8217;t imagine not having somewhat of a reprieve. 

Oh, and I should mention that I do full pushups, not on my knees. And for crossfit, you drop down completely chest to ground. 

I completed the workout in 21:01. I was glad to gut it through, because it was definitely one of the most challenging workouts I&#8217;ve ever done. But I was really proud to gut through it. I actually had a bit of a second wind on my last three handstand pushups, perhaps because I knew it was so close. My last pushup took me two tries! But I didn&#8217;t want to skimp and not complete.

I hobbled out of the box, legs still sore from Tuesday and now my shoulders aching from the day. 

And it was glorious.
