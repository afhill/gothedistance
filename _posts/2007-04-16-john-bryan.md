On the phone this morning, Meredith mentioned running the Pig in a few weeks. I had considered it in the past, then dismissed it. Her mentioning it made me think about it again, but there&#8217;s the honest facts:

1) I am not trained for a (road) marathon  
2) a marathon the day after Alex&#8217;s birthday party may not be a smart idea

However, I recently read about the [John Bryan State Park 50K](http://www.orrrc.org/calendar/johnByran50k.html) being held April 29th. Yes, it probably seems strange that I would consider a 50K the week before this marathon I feel I&#8217;m not ready for, but here&#8217;s another nice list:

1) trail races are easier on the joints and more fun  
2) I LOVE John Bryan  
3) it&#8217;s cheaper  
4) it&#8217;s closer  
5) It&#8217;s two loops you do 4 times each, so I could run 4, 8, 12, 16, etc etc miles. I&#8217;m not held to the entire distance

With the weather turning nicer, I&#8217;ve been feeling more energetic and wanting to get out more. On Saturday I was feeling sluggish and lazy, and I realized that it&#8217;s probably due to the fact that for 3 years now, I have run nearly every Saturday morning: that&#8217;s how I start my weekend. Not doing it throws my schedule off. I need to get back into it, even if it&#8217;s only for a few miles!
