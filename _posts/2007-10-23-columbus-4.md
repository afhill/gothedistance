My ankle was a bit sore starting around mile 20, and my knee gave me problems at mile 24. The next day they were both sore, but they&#8217;re already fine, and I&#8217;m dreaming of the next one!

As soon as I finished, a friend suggested how much fun it would be for me to run Napa Valley in March.. it looks gorgeous, so I told her I may consider doing it, &#8220;for her&#8221;&#8230; we&#8217;ll see!!
