#### Food

  * 4:00am-Banana bread muffins with Greek yogurt. Simple, but not as nutritionally dense as I should have. I also don&#8217;t want to eat stuff with added sweeteners (natural or not) first thing in the morning. Really, I should be limiting their intake all the time. P.s. This is a paragraph, not a bullet point 
  * 7:45am &#8211; larabar
  * 9:30MST/8:30PST &#8211; apple
  * 9:30am &#8211; veggie omelet with egg whites, avocado, mushrooms, spinach. dry rye toast. fresh orange juice
  * 10:00am &#8211; tea
  * 1:00pm &#8211; three-bean vegetarian chili, multi-grain bread
  * 3:00pm &#8211; sesame chickpea sandwich on multi-grain bread
  * 4:30pm &#8211; odwalla strawberry soy protein drink 
  * 6:30pm &#8211; salad with shrimp, egg and avocado

#### Exercise

  * **rolling** out of bed at 3:30am
  * **lugging** my carry-on through two airports and the train
  * **dragging** myself home at 11:30pm

One-day trips to California = rest day. My first flight was 6am and we landed back in Denver at 10:30pm (25 minutes early, but still not &#8220;early&#8221;).
