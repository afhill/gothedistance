The Coulmbus marathon is just around the corner.. the first marathon I ran back in 2004, the marathon I sandwiched in the middle of my &#8220;three marathons in three weeks&#8221; in 2005.. my hometown classic. 

Can you guess where I&#8217;m going with this?

Last Sunday I ran 20 miles @ an 8:32 pace. By Wed, I felt great. So what if I ran Columbus nice and slow (say, a 9 min mile, like last year) the week before Chicago? 

And of course, I don&#8217;t have good influences to talk to. I texted Helen and Doug about it. Helen said &#8220;run Akron THIS weekend!&#8221; and Doug said &#8220;I was having the same evil thought (about Columbus)&#8221;.

What to do, what to do.. registration goes up Saturday, so I have til then to decide. But a big part of me wants to do it, for the sake of tradition&#8230;
