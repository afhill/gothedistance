we had our first dump of snow yesterday, and it&#8217;s a bit chilly today (19F). But heck, I&#8217;m Canadian, I love it! Ran my mile to the gym in pants and a long sleeved cotton shirt (over a tank and shorts for the gym), worked out, and ran home. Threw on a toque and went out for another three miles. Personally, I love sloshing about on snow, it reminds me of trail running where you have to pay attention to the surface. Keeps me occupied.

Unfortunately, those types of runs make me think about those darned trail runs Helen keeps suggesting.. today was just FUN!
