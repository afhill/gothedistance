Today was a regular ole day and then I decided a cheat day was in order. Ah, the temptation of fair food! (Lemonade and funnel cakes!) I went to my first ever corn maze. After wandering that for awhile, I decided to lace up my trail shoes and did a beautiful run. Not the 20 miler I was SUPPOSED to do, but I&#8217;m still feeling crappy. Hopefully on the road to recovery, though!

Food  
&#8211; kodiak flapjacks with added egg protein powder and chia seed, with earth balance and blueberries. I&#8217;m still not entirely sure why I bought egg protein powder when I also buy egg whites. I&#8217;m really not a big fan :-/  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; odwalla superfood smoothie  
&#8211; veggie bologna, spinach, tomatoes, hemp seed, cilantro in a whole wheat tortilla  
&#8211; lemonade  
&#8211; funnel cake (shared with 4 other people)  
&#8211; chocolate chip zucchini cake  
&#8211; Vega sport performance protein  
&#8211; margarita  
&#8211; bean burrito, chile relleno, chips and guac  
&#8211; airborne  
&#8211; warm milk with turmeric and ginger  
&#8211; Reese&#8217;s peanut butter cup

Exercise  
&#8211; 3.75 miles trail running
