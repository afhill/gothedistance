This was the step-up week for the Pfitz plan, so I ran Mon, Tues and Wed. Today&#8217;s my day off, which I don&#8217;t really feel I need, but I&#8217;m sure my body appreciates it. I met Meredith and Mike at 5 yesterday for 11, and felt pretty darned good! Alot stronger than last week, despite the fact it was still hot and sunny. I definitely feel I&#8217;m getting back into it! Tuesday I did my 4 miles of recovery, but threw in a quarter mile at a 6 min pace, which didn&#8217;t feel too tough. I think I&#8217;m going to start doing that sort of thing everytime I have a treadmill run, just to get my legs used to the speed. 

I&#8217;ve decided not to run the Buckeye Classic 10K on Sunday. It was interfering with my schedule (supposed to do 16 on Saturday) as well as the plans for my big 2-9 birthday weekend (ok, I&#8217;m not sure what the plans are, but I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;re not getting up before 7am both weekend mornings to run).

Feeling good!
