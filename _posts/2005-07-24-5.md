First week of Pfitz 55/12, I was right on. I even tacked on one loop around Goodale on Saturday to bring myself up to the 13 miles I was supposed to run.

This week may be challenging, and I have alot else on my plate:

Monday: LT 8mi w/ 4mi @ half marathon pace  
Tuesday: Rest or CT  
Wednesday: medium-long run 11mi  
Thursday: Rest or CT  
Friday: Recovery 5mi  
Saturday: 10mile New Albany Race + 5  
Sunday: Rest or CT

The rest of life:  
Monday: Training in Fairborn 8am, Nikki&#8217;s going away at 8pm  
Tuesday: Driving school 6-9pm, stay in Dayton  
Wednesday: Training in Dayton 8:30 &#8211; 4:30, Kelley staying in Columbus  
Thursday: Training in Dayton 8:30 &#8211; 4:30, Jen&#8217;s show at 8pm  
Friday: Training in Dayton 8:30 &#8211; 4:30

I think I&#8217;ll do Monday&#8217;s run after work, actually rest on Tues, get up early and run on Wed (especially since I&#8217;ll be in Dayton!), run after training on Friday. Shouldn&#8217;t be too bad I guess&#8230; hurrah for the rest days this early in the schedule!
