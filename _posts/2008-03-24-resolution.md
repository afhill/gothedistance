Today was definitely the day after a long run: I drank a lot of water last night, but my throat still managed to get sore. I had little energy all day, my eyes were sore. Overall I felt like I was getting sick.

I am still dedicated to my New Year&#8217;s Resolution, however, so I set out to run a mile&#8230; and felt just fine. Actually, it was the best I felt all day! Ended up running 3.15m. My right knee started to feel something across the top at mile 1.5, but it passed. 

This week will be tough: tomorrow night is a co-worker&#8217;s going away party, I have dinner plans Wednesday, and I start dog-sitting Thursday night through Sunday. Hopefully I can get in some decent miles, but no guarantees as to how high of quality of workouts they&#8217;ll be&#8230;
