Interesting, today on the run Meredith said my name wasn&#8217;t listed on the Indian Run 10K listings. So I took another look today: I&#8217;m on the overall 10K listing, but not in the age group category. What the heck? So I emailed Premier Races. It doesn&#8217;t make sense that I&#8217;m listed on one page but not the other. It&#8217;s not a huge deal, but if there is some rule that states I shouldn&#8217;t have been able to run both, I want my $25 back! ðŸ™‚
