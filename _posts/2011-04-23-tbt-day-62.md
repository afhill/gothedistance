#### Food

  * Quinoa, lowfat milk, strawberries
  * A TON of yummy vegan food: check my post about the [vegan cooking class](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/04/vegan-cooking/) I attended. The only bad thing was the Rice Stick noodles, but I didn&#8217;t have much üôÅ
  * Larabar 
  * &#8220;Japanese style healthy snack bar&#8221; (labeled &#8220;delicious vegetarian food&#8221;) I got at the Asian market. The ingredients were intriguing so I picked it up. Yes, I know sugar is listed but I thought it was far enough down the list it wouldn&#8217;t be too bad. Ingredients: brown rice, husked lotus, pearl barley, buck wheat, oatmeal, pea, small red bean mung bean, speckled kidny (sic) bean, black soy bean, black glutinous rice, corn, taro powder, palm oil, granulated sugar, soy sauce powder, spice, sugar. Oh! the package also says &#8220;This product is manufactured from cereals of 12 kinds of natural by the latest science and technology an antiseptic and nor spice are added. Natural is the best, lease do for food with a concentrated mind.&#8221; Amen! Note: these absolutely taste processed and have a really weird &#8220;is it sweet or not&#8221; taste. Definitely not a clean food! 
  * hemp hummus, spinach, tomato on pumpernickel bread
  * peanut butter on sesame rye crispbread
  * sugar snap peas
