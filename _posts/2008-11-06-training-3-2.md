On Oct 27th, I started my McMillan Training plan. So far, I haven&#8217;t completed a single workout on the scheduled day, but I have managed to get in most of the workouts. Just 1.5 weeks in, I&#8217;m already feeling pretty good about it all.

There is a long run on Saturdays and another key workout on Wednesdays, and then the rest of the week I am to run 20-30min or 70-80min &#8220;easy&#8221;. Except &#8212; according to the McMillan Calculator, for a 3:23:00 marathoner, an &#8220;easy&#8221; pace is between 8:15-8:45mm!

When I first started training, I was a bit intimidated by the idea of running for 70-80min at that pace. However, it already seems to be &#8220;normal&#8221;. I do many of my workouts on the treadmill because I don&#8217;t want to run outside in the dark, but even when I head outside I find myself naturally gravitating to that pace. 

10/27: 2.5 miles @ 8:25, avgHR 165  
10/28: 8.25miles @ 8:39, avgHR 168  
10/29: 3miles @ 8:18, avgHR 168  
10/30: 9miles @ 7:55 &#8211; (8:29, 8:13, 8:18. 7:25, 7:29, 7:23, 7:24. 8:20, 8:11) , avgHR 174  
10/31: 8.25miles @ 8:35, avgHR 162  
11/1: 12miles @ 9:07, avgHR 163  
11/2: took a rest day  
11/3: travelling: didn&#8217;t have time üôÅ  
11/4: 2.75miles @ 8:15, avgHR 164  
11/5: 8.5miles @ 8:19, avgHR 159  
11/6: 7.91miles @8:28 &#8211; (15min w/u, 5x(5 min fast, 3min recovery), 12min c/d), avgHR 168

So it appears I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with a 168HR. The run on 11/5 felt good &#8211; I did a bit further within my ~70minutes, and yet my HR was a bit lower. I will be interested to see how things continue to go!

This weekend (well, the next few weeks) should be tough: my folks are coming in from out of town, and I&#8217;m attending a weekend seminar. However, 5:30am wake-up is almost starting to feel normal&#8230;
