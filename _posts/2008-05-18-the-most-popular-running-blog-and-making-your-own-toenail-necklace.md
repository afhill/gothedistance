Today was a podcast-listening day on the ole course; I listened to one episode of [phedippidations](http://phedippidations.steverunner.com/) and then went on to [enduranceplanet](http://enduranceplanet.com/). One of the endurance planet interviews I listened to was with Scott Dunlap. Once upon a time I&#8217;d read his blog, but I didn&#8217;t keep up consistently. Today as I listened, I was surprised to hear how popular it really is, so I decided to give it another try (I was also really interested to hear about his work: Scott is CEO for Nearbynow, a really cool mobile shopping app). Anyway: I checked out his blog at runtrails.blogspot.com, and then took a quick glance at his most popular post: &#8220;[making your own toenail necklace](http://runtrails.blogspot.com/2007/03/making-your-own-toenail-necklace.html)&#8221; (complete with photo!)  
Oh yes, trail runners are indeed a sick lot! 

And of course, I subscribed right away! ðŸ™‚
