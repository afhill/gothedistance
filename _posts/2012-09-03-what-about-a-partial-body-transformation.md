A bunch of people have started a new round of the TBT. I&#8217;m not participating because frankly my diet is more restrictive than the plan and I don&#8217;t need the structure to force me to work out and eat well. Also, I don&#8217;t really have any specific body-transformational goals to take on. That being said, I DO like the tracking and accountability aspect. And since I&#8217;ll be monitoring the TBT Facebook page anyway (I&#8217;m the admin), I may as well use some of the motivation for my own purposes.

So, no TBTing, but I&#8217;ll post some of my workouts or food now and then so I can look back and see what&#8217;s working or not, and hopefully have some accountability.

FWIW, my diet is about 90% vegan, gluten-free, artificial-sweetener-free and sugar-free. I don&#8217;t make anything with animal products or gluten at home but being out in the real world offers some challenges at times. 

My very specific fitness goal is to bench-press 70lbsx50 by next May. Yes, I set long-term goals ðŸ™‚  
Since moving to Boulder Ive given up crossfit and increased my running mileage. I feel less fit than I used to, so I am thinking I want to get back at least to the gym to lift more frequently. This is another reason why I want to half jump on this bandwagon, so I can encourage myself to go! I am training for the Columbus marathon and want to cut 5 min off my time from Houston this past Jan. I&#8217;ll probably reassess my training regimen after that. Right now I feel really worn down from my training, but of course if it works, I probably won&#8217;t want to abandon it completely! 

&#8212;-  
Today I hit the gym before meeting Frida and Fanny for lunch. I worked on my bench press endurance (with just the 45lb bar, I did 30, 20, 10), and also did a ton of different pushups. I worked on my back a bit and did some abs as well. I did a few single leg squats but nothing too intense for my legs. I really want to hammer them but I&#8217;m running pretty well every day and I can&#8217;t risk being too sore!

**edit:** more workout fun! Sean Davis from Davis Bootcamp sent out an email of a killer at-home workout (apparently he&#8217;s going to start sending a series of &#8216;Monday Madness&#8217; workouts). In the morning I forwarded to my roommate Yi-Nan and asked if she wanted to do them with me. She agreed, and then I sorta forgot. At 8pm she asked when we were going to do it. Dangit&#8230;.! I was just finishing dinner so I told her I needed some digestion time. At 8:45 we cleared the furniture from the living room (ok, she did) and we got to it!  
Set a clock for 15 minutes.  
Do 5 Burpees  
5 Lunges each leg (10 total)  
5 plyo pushups (jumping push ups or clapping)  
5 Star Jumps  
5 Burpees (again)  
Then bear crawl 5 lengths of your floor (down, back, down, back, down)  
Repeat this workout for 15 minutes!

I wonder if she regrets me moving in&#8230; ðŸ˜‰
