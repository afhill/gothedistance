There&#8217;ll be thousands of runners at Disney this January; the marathon and half marathon sold out in record time.

But yours truly won&#8217;t be on her own in the crowds: I&#8217;m now officially on a &#8216;team&#8217;!

_Team members will receive a special team bib number, access to the Team Reunion area at the Finish Line, and exclusive Team Check-in at Disney&#8217;s Health and Fitness Expo._ 

My first official race as a &#8220;Marathon Maniac&#8221;, I&#8217;ll be on a team with other like-minded marathon junkies. Looks as though there will actually be two teams, so I&#8217;ll have a great opportuity to meet some new folks (not to mention, Bob and Paul will be there as well&#8230;)
