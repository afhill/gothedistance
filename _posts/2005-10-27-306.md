Ok, re-evaluation of those training paces I mentioned. Those weren&#8217;t specifically geared to the speed i want in the half this year. So instead:

&#8211;Long runs: 8:27 &#8211; 9:33 min/mile  
&#8212; VO2: 6:20 min/mile  
&#8212; Tempo: 7:01 min/mile

(Yasso: 3:14/800)

I was most concerned about the speed stuff, but when I look back at my track workouts from last summer, I was hitting that Yasso time and then backing off. So I know I CAN do it,the question is maintaining it.

Now I just have to figure out when to start this training (I don&#8217;t want to do any speedwork for awhile til I&#8217;m recovered from Marathon Month)
