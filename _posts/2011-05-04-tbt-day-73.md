#### Food

  * green goodness smoothie pre-workout
  * banana
  * tea
  * amazing breakfast burrito from whole foods&#8230; Having wf right by work is going to be dangerous! Whole wheat tortilla, eggs, potatoes (prob bad), vegetarian chili, guacamole, mango salsa, cilantro
  * larabar
  * kung pao tofu, black bean quinoa salad, Ezekiel sprouted grain tortilla
  * sugar snap peas
  * non-fat latte
  * dried apples
  * vitamin water zero (which I am considering clean b/c it uses a very small amount of stevia as a sweetener)
  * [hazelnut espresso cookies](http://www.eatcleandiet.com/food_and_recipes/clean_recipe/hazelnut_espresso_cookies.aspx) &#8211; not an ideal post-workout snack, but we stopped skating and were talking and I wanted to eat SOMETHING
  * recovery pudding
  * cottage cheese

We started a [Door to Door Organics Co-op](http://colorado.doortodoororganics.com/about/coop_faq.php) at derby, so today [Double Easy](http://yinanpants.wordpress.com) and arrived at scrimmage to nice big boxes of produce! I also like the idea that we can trade; like school lunches as a kid! I got the bitty veggie box (but then swapped in some fruit), she got the bitty fruit box. Look for green beans and yams to show up in my food listing soon! (The co-op is cool: food is delivered to a central location, and DRD get a kickback!)

#### Exercise

  * 1 hr session with my trainer
  * 3hrs derby

I felt pretty good today, exercise-wise. Honestly, I think the caffeine helped for scrimmage :-/ I did have a couple good falls on my knees that jarred me mentally, but overall I feel okay. I&#8217;m definitely on the route to recovery, emotionally as well as physically.
