10pm &#8211; fruition protein drink

Well, I have the &#8216;eat every 2-3 hours&#8217; down just fine! I&#8217;m really trying hard to combine a protein and a carb, which means a lot of almond eating..

This morning I had an early flight out of Boston. I knew I had practice tonight, so a workout was going to have to be early. This blog kept me accountable, I thought about those 4:30 wake-ups Frida did for several MONTHS and figured I could manage for a day. 

It was my first scrimmage back since my hip bursitis diagnosis last month. I felt pretty good! I&#8217;m definitely a lot more stable on my skates and haven&#8217;t totally lost my agility. Good thing, since we&#8217;re off to a tournament next weekend!
