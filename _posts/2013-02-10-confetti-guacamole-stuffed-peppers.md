Last night I attended my first vegan potluck here in Boulder! My friends Rick and Laura invited me, and I actually got excited to be able to try out some recipes. I brought two things: one I was sure would go over well, and another test item.

The one I knew would be a winner was something I found on Choosingraw.com &#8211; [Peppers stuffed with confetti guacamole](http://www.choosingraw.com/red-peppers-stuffed-with-confetti-guacamole-a-super-bowl-sunday-dish/).

What is confetti guacamole, you may ask? Basically it&#8217;s guacamole with kale, zucchini, red onion, bell pepper and chickpeas (and lime juice). I adore guacamole, but this made for a really special treat with all the added bits!

As I was prepping this for the party, I hadn&#8217;t considered the prep time in dicing all the veggies, so this actually took longer than I&#8217;d have expected. But it was great! 

The recipe said it would make enough for 6, so I scaled it up for the 8 people we were supposed to bring food for. I still ended up with ton of extra stuffing, score! It was great on a sandwich the next morning as well. Definitely a keeper!
