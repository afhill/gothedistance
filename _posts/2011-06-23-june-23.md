I&#8217;m not tracking to a certain date, so it doesn&#8217;t make sense to do a countdown. And I&#8217;m not great at coming up with witty titles. 

My arm workout felt great, but as the day wore on I started dreading my run. Speedwork is hard! But I set to it, and it actually went well. I was close to a tenth of a mile for my sprints, so about a 6mm pace. But I know the drill, if I want to do big races, I need to train!

Michael furthered sweetened the deal re: Goofy today. Marshall Ulrich was in Seattle for the marathon, signing and selling his book &#8220;Running on Empty&#8221;. I&#8217;d mentioned it to Michael the other day, and sure enough I just got an mms of an autographed book! How can I not make an effort to go run a race with a great friend like that?? ðŸ™‚
