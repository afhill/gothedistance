My Mom has talked about running the Chicago marathon next year, but apparently its come up more frequently as of late (as I&#8217;m getting more excited about running again). She can get in via an International Tour Partner (as she did for New York), so I better make sure I can get there with her!

If 2015 is like 2014, I can earn guaranteed entry with a 3:45:00 after 1/1/2013. However, I haven&#8217;t run a marathon since then (what? I had to [check myself](http://www.marathonmaniacsdb.com/Maniacs/MyMarathons.asp?ManiacId=194), but it&#8217;s true), so I better buckle down!

I&#8217;m running the New York marathon in twelve weeks, and I had been toying around with goals. So here they are as of now:

1. 3:30:xx I first ran 3:30:05 in 2005. Nine years and thirty marathons ago! I&#8217;d love to get back to this pace but I know it&#8217;ll definitely take a lot of hard work.  
2. BQ: 3:40:00  
3. CQ: (Chicago qualifier): 3:45:00  
4. Sub-4. 

So that&#8217;s roughly a range of 8mm &#8211; 9:09. I&#8217;m not even sure I could go out and run a half at 9:09 right now, but I guess that&#8217;s the point of STARTING a training plan. Oh, and running at sea level ðŸ™‚ 

I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be able to know how things will go until I get a lot closer to November 3rd, but at least I have these in my mind to work towards. Im pretty excited about getting some strength and speedwork in. Just remembering what it feels like to be fast! 

I&#8217;m already signed up for the RnR Arizona half in January, so if I don&#8217;t meet #3 above, I may just need to modify that registration to give myself another chance!
