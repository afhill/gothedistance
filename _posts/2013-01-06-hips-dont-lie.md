I wish I remembered exactly when I noticed my right hip giving me a bit of trouble. In the past week I started doing a lot of ab work, I&#8217;ve done yoga twice and got a deep tissue massage. And, you know, run 50 miles. 

The massage therapist may have been the first to tip me off. He worked on my abs and lower back and it was really tight on the right side! I was glad he did it, but I think that drew my attention to my right side. Also, I noticed my obliques were a little sore during our Wednesday hill workout. 

My right hip had given me some trouble leading up to the RnRAZ marathon 2 years ago, but I trained through it. It culminated in my [dropping out of the marathon](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/01/race-face/), getting a diagnosis of hip bursitis and having to go through some PT. Oddly enough, it had been my right hip that hurt me leading up to the race but ultimately my left was the one that did me in. 

That&#8217;s NOT going to happen again! So I went and got dry-needled on Friday: my own lacrosse ball and foam rolling hadn&#8217;t helped. Larry the chiro put the needles into my glutes, and I definitely felt things loosen up &#8211; to the point where I felt like I was dragging my leg out of the place! But I ran yesterday and it didn&#8217;t feel great, and steadily ached through the day. 

Today we went up to Magnolia Rd, and with the first step my hip was hurting. It&#8217;s so odd; it feels like the skin is stretched too tight over the hip bone: what do you do with that??

So, I&#8217;ve decided I won&#8217;t run for the next few days and I&#8217;m going to hit up my old hip PT exercises again (we do some of them with Jay&#8217;s GSM work, but obviously I need more). I spoke with Larry and he said to check in with him tomorrow and we may do another session in a day or two. I&#8217;m grasping a bit at what to do: not sure if stretching or letting it relax is the best approach. I just know I&#8217;m not going to continue on as &#8216;business as usual&#8217;. My race is in two weeks, my fitness is there and I just need to get to the start line as healthy as possible&#8230;
