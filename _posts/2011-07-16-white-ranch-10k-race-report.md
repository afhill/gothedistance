Today was the White Ranch 10K, put on by the [Colorado Masters Running/RaceWalking Association](http://www.comastersrun.org/Race_Info/2011/WhiteRanch.html). Their races are pretty low-key and inexpensive. At only $10 (or if you get a yearly $25 membership, the races are free), it seemed a great tune-up race for the relay next week. 5 of us (Frida, Phoebee, Alexa, Queen and I) decided to give it a try. 

It was a gorgeous day, I wore my Team Run Wild tank, shorts and a hat, and carried my water bottle. I didn&#8217;t really know the course, other than the fact it was trails with rolling hills. The first mile was a nice steady descent.. which of course meant an uphill was imminent.

I started out in front of the group, then just past the first mile Frida passed me. I let her go for a bit, then caught up around mile 3. We stayed close for a few of the gross uphills, then there was a water stop at 3.8. She stopped for water and I took off. I actually hit a really good stride there; it was a subtle descent and my legs just did what they know to do. A few more uphills came along but nothing I couldn&#8217;t handle.

In the last little bit, I saw another girl ahead of me. I started pushing the pace.. and then we turned a corner and I saw there was probably still a half mile to go. So I slowed. Ugh! Still, I came in in 55:57 I believe, a good effort for the course. 

A few things I reflected on and learned during this race: I definitely have an endurance athlete&#8217;s mentality. Even when the course went downhill in the middle, I held something back to be sure I could finish. I didn&#8217;t ever push myself to the limit. I also have an annoying habit of catching up to people, but then stopping to get some energy before passing them. I do this with derby too; get hung up behind blockers. I need to practice accelerating from an already-decent clip, just learning how to push the legs to turn over faster. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve recognized it and know a way to try to get over it. 

Frida came in a couple minutes after me, and the other girls not too much later. I was happy to see everyone positive and happy about the run. It was just such a gorgeous course and nice run, how could you not enjoy? A few of them said they&#8217;d run it again, and talked about possibly joining the club to do more of their races. I&#8217;m glad everyone enjoyed, and I&#8217;m even more excited for next week!

Because it IS a master&#8217;s group, there were lots of age group awards for more, ahem, mature runners. Then there was one big lump of a &#8220;19-34&#8221; age group. Sad &#8211; I got 4th in that, but I think if there&#8217;d been a 30-34, I would have placed 2nd and Frida 3rd. Oh well.. 

It was fun to race, and I love trails. I&#8217;m disappointed I won&#8217;t be doing the Barr Trail Mountain Race tomorrow but I&#8217;m happy I got this one in. I love living in Colorado!
