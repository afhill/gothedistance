I met a friend for lunch today and the pizza smelled soooo good: I&#8217;m pretty sure I haven&#8217;t had pizza in a month! The selection was still reasonably healthy (veggies, no mozzarella cheese, and we asked for whole wheat crust.. The verdict is still out if they delivered on that). I definitely ate a lot and really enjoyed it, but afterwards felt like I could have made a different choice. I think it&#8217;s good for me to feel that way, that I&#8217;m not necessarily depriving myself, but it&#8217;s not like I NEED that pizza.  
Before practice I tried a &#8220;Greens+ omega chia energy bar&#8221;. It was high in sugar and had some saturated fat but it sure tasted good! Generally I dont like chocolate-flavored energy bars but this one was good, and the inside actually reminded me of a Turkish delight (a bit jellyish with the chocolate). 

This morning I hit up the gym and did chest and shoulders. I already feel stronger! Then tonight I went to Bootcamp, which was a pretty intensive circuit that really got my heart going: incline skull-crushers, forward/back hop lunges (each leg), a sandbag clean and press, suicide sprints, assisted chinups and burpees. We did each for a minute, then rested a minute, three times. Then I went to MHC practice, which was good. I felt really strong out there skating, though I&#8217;m not totally back on full contact. But I felt like I was powerful and strong and things are coming along!

Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to see that personal trainer after work: looking forward to it!
