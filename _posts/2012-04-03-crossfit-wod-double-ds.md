Yeah, they didn&#8217;t officially call the WOD that, but that&#8217;s what it was!

>   * 1 RM Deadlift
>   * 3 rounds of: 
>       * 10 deadlifts at 60% 1RM
>       * 50 Double-unders

I don&#8217;t MIND deadlifts (although I tend to smash my shins), but I can&#8217;t do a double-under to save my life! However.. I guess I&#8217;ll never learn if I don&#8217;t try&#8230;

I wasn&#8217;t sure what my 1RM for the deadlift would be. The coach Leo said he guessed based on my other lifts it would be up around 200lbs. He recommended we start around 60%, do 5 reps, then go up 10% and do 4 reps, up 10% and do 3.. until we got to our max and then see if we could go up a bit more. I started at 133lbs, fine. I didn&#8217;t worry about the 10% and added on 22lbs. 4 reps, fine. Then I got to 177lbs and&#8230; nothing. I actually started laughing because it seemed so ridiculous, that bar could have been glued to the ground! Spent a bit of time getting set again (Leo said I&#8217;d had some slack in my arms) and then managed to lift it. But I decided that was it. 

So, **1RM Deadlift = 177lbs.**

Then we backed down the weight (I went down to 111lbs) for the rest of the workout. The lift was fine but I couldn&#8217;t even get a single double-under. So my modification was that I had to do 3 single jumps for each double-under. So that&#8217;s 150 reps for each set. That&#8217;s a lot of jumping rope! I actually found that even with singles, I never got past 23 reps without getting caught. 

So&#8230; I sorta hate doing things I&#8217;m not good at. And even after 450 revolutions, I&#8217;m not convinced I got ANY better at jumping rope. It&#8217;s not the jumping so much as the wrist rotation, I felt awkward and just couldn&#8217;t get my speed up. 

In all, I finished the workout in 8:41. I didn&#8217;t particularly feel tired, just frustrated. But again.. probably something I need now and then!
