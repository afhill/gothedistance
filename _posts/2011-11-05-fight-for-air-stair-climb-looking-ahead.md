In 2010, I completed the 56 stories in 10:04 and I bettered that by exactly a minute in 2011. I came in at 9:04, but I was caught up behind a traffic jam at the top and missed qualifying for elite runner status by 5 seconds. I still managed to place 3rd female overall. 

In 2012, I&#8217;ll be joining [Team COS Incline Fanatics](http://ala.convio.net/site/TR/Climb/ALASW_Southwest/1759891597?pg=team&fr_id=3950&team_id=36174) &#8211; a group of folks who seem to be associated with the Incline Club and Colorado Springs Running Scene. I&#8217;m pretty jazzed about being invited to join them &#8211; last year they [won the Team competition](http://onlineraceresults.com/race/view_plain_text.php?race_id=17939) pretty handily, with an average pace 59 seconds faster than the second place team.

Team results are calculated with the top 5 times from team members. The COS Incline Fanatics score included the #2 male, #5 male, #7 male and #1 female. The &#8220;slowest&#8221; team score used was 8:14!

Over on the women&#8217;s side, my potential future teammate Kim Dobson took first in 8:12, then came Jennifer Northrip in 8:29. She and I are in the same age group so she got the accolades for that. 

I feel pretty confident I can do sub-8:30 &#8211; when I consider that I was still undergoing PT when I ran last year, and I&#8217;m sooo much stronger now! I think in my head I see a bit of a performance ceiling there, wondering how I can hope to do much better than I did this year. Which is silly: there should be no reason why I assume there always need to be a few women ahead of me. Two years ago, the winning female time was 8:27. Did Kim think &#8220;wow, no one can go faster than that?&#8221; No, she did what she could do. And come Feb 26th, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do too!

Part of this event is a fundraiser, I&#8217;d love if you were willing to [make a donation to the American Lung Association](http://ala.convio.net/site/TR/Climb/ALASW_Southwest/1759891597?px=3101719&pg=personal&fr_id=3950)!
