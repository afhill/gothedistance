**Monday**  
Plan: 8mi w/ 4 @ HMP  
Actual: &#8220;the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak&#8221;. No, it&#8217;s not even that! It&#8217;s all a matter of time. This morning I got up and headed to work to hit the treadmill. I&#8217;m not even a big treadmill fan, but I felt ok, actually felt the 1mi repeats were easier with each one. But the clock was looming above me so I cut another Monday workout short. Ugh! I did a 1.5 mile warmup, then repeated a mile at HMP followed by a half mile easy interval. At eight I realized the time, and that I had another fast mile and the cooldown to go, which would have made me rushed for my morning meeting, so I cut it short. But I told myself that Meredith had planned 6/3, so it was ok if that&#8217;s what I did too ðŸ™‚  
Mileage: 6mi daily (3 @ HMP), 6mi for the week

**Tuesday**  
rest

**Wednesday**  
Plan:11mi  
Actual: 11mi w/ Meredith and Mike. We met at the high school at 5pm. I forgot my knee sleeve, but ran anyway. Mike was bothered by how slow we were going, but it felt comfortable, and we got the miles in. I wore my HRM, glancing at it every so often. For alot of the run it maxed out at 170, but in the last mile, I could tell Mike smelled the barn because he was really picking it up, and I got up to 180. I dragged a bit the last couple miles, but got the miles in  
Mileage: 11mi daily, 17 for the week

**Thursday**  
rest

**Friday**  
Plan: recovery 4.5mi  
Actual: recovery 4.25mi  
Mileage: 4.25mi daily, 21.25 for the week

**Saturday**  
Plan: 15 miles  
Actual: Met the gang at Highbanks. I was a bit tired, and wasn&#8217;t feeling too hot (girl problems). Ran with the group for the first three miles, then did a couple more slow on my own before calling it quits. Went back home and slept for a few hours &#8211; all week I got up early to run, and I think it was catching up with me. Considered trying to make up the miles some other time over the weekend, but decided I could stand to give myself some extra recovery time.  
Mileage: 5mi daily, 26.25 for the week

**Sunday**  
rest
