Today was my speed workout, and despite having an 8am meeting (so I&#8217;d need to get up an hour earlier) AND having my alarm not go off at 4:30 as planned), I managed to make it to the gym by 5:30.

My target workout was:  
10min warmup,  
2x(.75mi @ 5:10), 2min RI  
2(.5mi @ 3:23), 2min RI  
10 min cooldown

.75= 5:05 (-5sec)  
.75 = 5:06 (-4sec)  
then it turns out I accidentally did .6 instead of .5: .6mi in 4:03 (which averages to 3:23 for .5))  
.5 = 3:24 (+1sec)  
.5 = 3:26 (+2sec)  
.5 = 3:24 (+1 sec)

Overall: 54:41 for 5.6 miles: the rest intervals generally involved a fair amount of walking ðŸ™‚ 

Overall my time was ok: my speedwork was a bit faster than my goal, although there was a definite drop-off as the workout went on. 

I was a bit sore at the end of the run: my right quad was achy (the track is a tenth of a mile and I was running counter-clockwise) but I was glad I pulled it off. 

My left knee and hamstring are pretty tight: They don&#8217;t hurt but there&#8217;s some limited motion in them. I need to get serious about stretching, and quick!
