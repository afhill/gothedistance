Today at the grocery store I picked up an acorn squash. I had no idea what to do with it, but came across [this recipe](http://tasty-yummies.com/2010/10/22/tofu-wild-rice-and-hazelnut-stuffed-acorn-squash/) when I got home. But.. I didn&#8217;t quite have all the right ingredients, so I improvised. So.. 

wild rice = brown rice  
hazelnut = almond  
sage = basil  
onion = no onion

I also steamed some asparagus, and it all turned out pretty good! The tofu was a bit lacking, but I&#8217;m not too concerned since this is the first time I&#8217;ve tried cooking with tofu. 

The meal was nice and filling. I&#8217;m definitely trying to move beyond my previous attempts at &#8220;cooking&#8221;, which primarily meant pasta, garlic bread and sauce.
