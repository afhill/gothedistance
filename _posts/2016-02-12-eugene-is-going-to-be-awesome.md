I&#8217;m really enjoying my Revolution Running training. Working hard, well beyond just doing long runs. 

Yesterday was my first tempo run with them:

15 min warmup, drills, then 2*12 at HMP (2min recovery) then 15 min cooldown.

The group I run with is FAST! There were about 6 people ahead of me and 2 with/behind me. I had thought I&#8217;d run around a 7:40 pace, and my ego didn&#8217;t let me get THAT far behind ðŸ™‚ 

Interval 1: 1.66miles in 12:04 (7:16 pace)  
Interval 2: 1.67miles in 11:58 (7:10 pace)

Even with speeding up the second time, the group ahead of me was even further away!

This morning I also did Orange Theory so now I&#8217;m wiped! 

Getting strong!
