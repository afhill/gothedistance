A couple years ago a friend introduced me to [Kombucha tea](http://www.synergydrinks.com/). I could only describe it as weird, but in a good way. I&#8217;d drink it maybe once a month, but not more frequently. Then I heard Ben Greenfield talk about it on <a href=http://www.enduranceplanet.com/sports-nutrition-a-new-take-on-electrolytes-and-more/">Endurance Planet</a>, and how he made his own. I was intrigued, and actually ended up googling information on making your own. It&#8217;s a pretty interesting process that requires starting from existing kombucha or a scoby (a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast). Mmmm, tasty. 

Two weeks ago I saw a posting on craiglist for a free scoby, so I decided what the heck. The guy I got my scoby from gave me instructions from [Laurel Farms](http://www.laurelfarms.com) and I gave it a try!

Oh, and sugar and Lipton tea. No white sugar in my house for me, only for my scoby ðŸ™‚

The instructions from Laurel Farms are pretty straightforward. Setting it up takes a bit of time but not much, there&#8217;s more waiting than actual doing. 

The instructions said to wait 7-10 days &#8211; the longer you wait, the more tart it would get. I waited 8 days and poured my first containers of kombucha. I made one just plain, one with fresh ginger, and one with frozen blueberries. I tried the plain one, and it tasted amazing!!

Note &#8211; I just realized that I&#8217;ve always been a fan of sweet tea, and maybe it&#8217;s just the tea and sugar I enjoy, and I should have let it get more tart. 

Once the tea is in containers, I&#8217;m now supposed to let it sit on the shelf for a few days to get carbonated. (Note: this wasn&#8217;t actually in the LaurelFarms instructions). Then I can refrigerate it and drink at my leisure!
