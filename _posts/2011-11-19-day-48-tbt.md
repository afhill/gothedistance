Although I didn&#8217;t get home til after 12:30 last night, I wanted to try to meet up with the RRB gang today. I had some more uneasy dreams (Thursday night was really bad) and was happy to wake up at 6. 

Food  
&#8211; Ezekiel toast with peanut butter  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; kombucha &#8211; sitting on the shelf it got nice and carbonated! (and grew another scoby. This is getting ridic)  
&#8211; water  
&#8211; honeymilk  
&#8211; eggplant bharta with brown rice  
&#8211; amazing meal with ff milk  
&#8211; edamame  
&#8211; [baked sweet tofu](http://www.eatcleandiet.com/the_kitchen_table/recipe/recipe.aspx?id=1399), brown rice, asparagus  
&#8211; gatorade  
&#8211; pomegranate seeds. This was my first time buying a whole pomegranate &#8211; what a pain! Now I understand why buying just the seeds is so expensive.

Exercise  
&#8211; 10.23 mile run with the RRB group. The first 15 min &#8220;steady pace&#8221; run was surprisingly tough but things went well after that once we got to the intervals. Darren asked if I wanted to join, so I&#8217;m in!  
&#8211; pushups  
&#8211; abs  
&#8211; bench press. I did a few reps at 85, can&#8217;t imagine having to do 30 üôÅ
