i just got back from the post office, where i mailed in my application for the paris marathon in 2007. I won&#8217;t say i&#8217;m running it yet &#8211; of the 35,000 places, there are only about 5,500 left, and they seem to fill about 1000 places a day. I sure hope &#8220;Guaranteed International Delivery&#8221; is as speedy as they say! I mailed in my app rather than applying online because it is only through the mail that you can apply for a &#8220;preferred bib&#8221; (for women, that&#8217;s <3:30). As well, everyone needs to submit a medical certificate saying they are in good enough health to participate. My doctor gave me a hand-written note on a prescription pad, hope that's sufficient! This will be the same weekend my friends are running Boston (and [Meredith](http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com) turns the big 2-9. Whatta weekend!
