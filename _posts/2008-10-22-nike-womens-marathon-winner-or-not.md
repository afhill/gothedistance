There has been some buzz lately about the [fastest participant in the Nike Women&#8217;s marathon not winning](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/20/BAUC13L3GQ.DTL). Evidently Arien O&#8217;Connell ran a fantastic PR race, the only sub-three marathon of the event. Yet because she was not registered as elite, she was not awarded the prize money.

For many people, this seems absolutely ludicrous. Was the whole point of chip timing not to ensure that the fastest runner, not the first to cross the line, received their proper reward? 

According to Jim Estes (associate director of the long-distance running program for USA Track and Field): &#8220;The theory is that, because they had separate starts, they weren&#8217;t in the same race,&#8221; Estes said. &#8220;The woman who is winning the elite field doesn&#8217;t have the opportunity to know she was racing someone else.&#8221;

Here&#8217;s the thing, though&#8230; with &#8216;only&#8217; a 20 minute head start, it&#8217;s not as though Arien could have benefited from knowing how the woman winning the elite field was doing either. 

This brings up something that has always struck me about distance running: who are we racing, the clock, or other competitors? There has been a general tendency for records only to be set when there is not competition between runners to &#8220;win&#8221;. It appears the strategies for racing against the clock vs another are different. In races where participants are jockeying for position, there tend to be more surges. From what I understand, a race where a record is at stake is often more of a steady-pace. A game plan can be set out in advance, and then orchestrated hopefully without deviation.

So what happened last weekend? Arien went out to run the best race she could. She set a 12 minute PR. She was racing the clock. Evidently the woman who ran the elite race is supposed to have been racing the other elites. Is that what makes it a different race? The differing goals? 

I know personally, I need to have a strict time goal in mind to race well. Any time I view the event as a &#8220;race to place&#8221;, I crash and burn (see: [Marshall Race Report](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2005/06/blisterburst-marathon-race-report/)). How do we determine motivation?
