I&#8217;m writing this post a week before the race, tentatively to post WHILE running. Its just too easy in blogland to edit/remove posts if reality doesn&#8217;t line up with our goals. But I think it&#8217;s important (for me at least) to write down the plan.

I posted about [my meeting with my coach](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/a-workout-and-planning-for-2012/) a week before the race. The first thing he said was that he thought I was being too conservative with my goal, and he thought I could run 3:10.

WHA WHA WHA???

Honestly, I&#8217;ve toyed with 3:15 in my head, but 3:10?? I wasn&#8217;t so sure.. but he&#8217;s done well thus far at anticipating my goals in [training runs](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/12/an-a-week/)). I tend to keep up with Lydia, who has a 3:09 PR and is going for 3:10 next week. 

He told me that he felt I should start with the 3:10 group and gauge how I&#8217;m feeling, how I can always see how I feel and if it&#8217;s not my day, I can relax and let the 3:20 group catch me. His sense is that if I try to go with the 3:20 group and then pick it up near the end (what I was planning), that I will be dodging a lot of folks at the end and wondering if I could have done better. 

It&#8217;s a little intimidating to try an aggressive pace and &#8220;see how it goes&#8221;. When he said that I thought about [Rock and Roll AZ in 2009](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/01/rock-and-roll-arizona-race-report/), when I actually ran a 3:22 pace until 21. Then I thought I was off my goal pace and let the wheels fall off. (Ok, so three years later, I JUST realized that was not off my goal pace (3:23). I think my heart just cracked a little&#8230;) I want Houston to be a good effort for me, and didn&#8217;t want to risk the mental breakdown I had that day. 

However, the more I think about it, the more I realize I didn&#8217;t have a backup goal in that race. I felt the wheels fell off and I slowed too much (which actually wasn&#8217;t the case) and that was a sign of a problem. But talking to Darren, he is encouraging me to go out aggressively and see what I can do. If that means at mile 20 (or 13, or 8) realizing that I&#8217;m not going to be able to sustain that pace, then I dial it back. No one says you have to run a marathon in a completely steady state (although of course it&#8217;s nice). It&#8217;s ok to run the first few faster, then dial it back (provided of course I don&#8217;t push to the point I&#8217;m building up lactic acid, burning through fuel too fast, etc etc). 

It&#8217;s fair to say my coach is blunt. I remember him telling us all about tracking one of our runners at CIM online and wondering &#8220;what the hell was he thinking (going out that fast)&#8221;. For awhile I&#8217;d been wondering if he was purposely giving me a really aggressive goal just to see what I&#8217;d do with it. But that doesn&#8217;t seem to fit with what I&#8217;ve seen of him so far. Just to be sure, I emailed another runner on the team just to get a sense if Darren gave &#8220;stretch goals&#8221; for races or not. I got back a very thoughtful response, including: 

> Everytime he has told me to shoot for a time in a race &#8211; he is spot on and I have run it (with the exception of a few races over the last 5 years where I just had a bad day). I hate to admit it but he is very good at it. And usually whatever he suggests will sound too hard to you &#8211; and you will say there is no way I can run that &#8211; and then if you decide to try it &#8211; you run it. But you do have to be willing to push yourself and commit to it. You have to decide if that is what you want to do. And it&#8217;s his job to push you a little bit harder than you would naturally push yourself.

I had to smile at the &#8220;I hate to admit it&#8221; part!

Well, what I received back from my teammate further helped me realize that I have ONE day &#8211; only a few hours &#8211; to put it on the line and see what I can do. Since we&#8217;re only talking about 2 fast marathons a year, that&#8217;s an awful long time to wonder where my level is at. 

I could plant all sorts of seeds of doubt in my mind, but for what? Why generate excuses for something that hasn&#8217;t transpired yet? I have a very talented coach who thinks I can achieve something. He doesn&#8217;t gain anything from seeing me falter. I&#8217;m thrive on external validation, and challenges. I have nothing to prove from running a &#8220;safe&#8221; race.
