Last Saturday I ran the Leadville Trail Marathon. But whereas after the Houston marathon I didn&#8217;t run a step for over a week afterwards, I had plans Ron run two races the Wednesday following the marathon. 

I understand the merits of recovery, though, so I didn&#8217;t run Sunday or Monday. I did a few easy miles on Tuesday and also went to AllSports. 

Wednesday I raced and felt pretty good at the time, but then went home and napped and generally lazed around and felt like I&#8217;d been run over by a truck. I felt better Thursday but forced myself not to work out, and instead went to AllSports again. 

I felt much better on Friday and went for a great run in Chautauqua. Saturday I met the RRBs for our workout. I ran the warmup chatting with Katie Blackett at the front of the pack. It was a tough workout of 1.5 mile repeats. I did the shorter option, but ran them all strong. It still ended up being about a 10 mile run in total. Then I went to the gym and hit it hard, fueled by iced coffee and Girl Talk. I ripped off 7&#215;7 @ 70lbs for the bench press to prep for going 50x70lbs next May. I did a fair amount of triceps work and then for some reason decided to work on my legs a bit too. I warned up with a 70lb deadlift, but when I went to hit 120lbs, my left ear popped. Wha??? Then I did a bunch of single leg presses and squat pulses. I was completely spent by the time I left, so I ate and then headed to AllSports where I iced and used the boots. 

This morning I met the RRBs for a run before we volunteered at the Boulder Peak Triathlon. I was feeling pretty stiff to start but got faster as we went on (first mile 9:01, last .4 of the 9.4 run at a 6:11 pace). I joked to everyone that my legs were fresh since I hadn&#8217;t run much this week!  
It was really humid and gross, and I spent the next 2 hrs squatting down pouring water for the athletes (no table where I was, the cups were on the ground). I got SO sore I actually needed to brace myself to stand up. Yikes!

Tonight I took a bath with Epsom salts and tried to roll my legs out a bit. It&#8217;s really a specific spot on the outside rear of my right knee that&#8217;s bugging me the most. Its really no surprise I&#8217;m a little sore, I still managed to run 35 miles this week with only 4 days of running, the week after a marathon. I just want to do what I can to recover mentally and physically. I know there is a lot more at play than just my legs and my whole nervous system may need some support too after this week&#8217;s hard efforts. I plan to play it by ear and take the time I need to get back to strong.
