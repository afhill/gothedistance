Just came across [a post](http://afhill.blogspot.com/2005/06/races-to-consider.html) I made in 2005 (when I was briefly trying out blogspot), where I listed out potential marathons.

Keeping in mind this was less than three years ago, I&#8217;ve done quite well at achieving them:

  * Chicago &#8211; Chicago, IL (completed 06)
  * Steamtown &#8211; Scranton, PA (completed in 05 and 07)
  * Las Vegas &#8211; Las Vegas, NV (completed 07)
  * DisneyWorld &#8211; Orlando, FL (completed 06)
  * New York City &#8211; NYC, NY
  * Erie Marathon at Presque Isle &#8211; Erie, PA
  * HealthyHuntington &#8211; Huntington, WV (completed 06)

Hmmm, looks like I have some new considerations to make! NYC is still on the list, for sure&#8230;
