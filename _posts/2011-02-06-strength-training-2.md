When I first moved to Columbus I frequented the gym quite, um, frequently, and enjoyed working with weights. As I got more into running, however, I spent less time at it. I dabble a bit but never really felt much from it. Then going to Better Bodies with Frida last week really got me motivated again: she encouraged me to push beyond the silly light weights I&#8217;ve been using for years. And lo and behold, heavier weights denote more effort, which results in more adrenaline and results, and more enjoyment! So today I hit up the gym in the complex to work on arms and shoulders (what we did the other day), and now I&#8217;m browsing bodybuilding.com to figure out what else I can do. 

Confession: they have a widget you can download to show exercises. That&#8217;s what prompted this post.

I bought a kettlebell a loooong time ago, I think I&#8217;ve used in once. Guess what I&#8217;m going to do when I stop writing this??
