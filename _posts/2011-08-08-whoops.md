Lately I&#8217;ve been stressed, not eating as well as I could and not exercising as much as I&#8217;d like. I&#8217;ve underperformed at my last two derby bouts, which then contributes to the stress as well. 

I managed to make it to the gym today, and expected the scale to read s little light. I was really surprised though to see 113! That&#8217;s far too light! I think I need to get back officially on the TBT to make myself accountable. I&#8217;m still eating decent now, but obviously not enough.

I did the mad abs class and the power 30. The power 30 is like Bootcamp: we were to do up to 5 sets of: 20 rotated side planks, 10 burpees, 20 pushups with a medicine ball, 20 one-armed bent-over rows, 10 &#8230; Things where you hold a weight over your head as you laybon your back, then stand up with the weight still extended. Apparently I did a harder version, basically doing a one-legged squat. We realized I was mostly just doing it with my right so I forced myself to do it with my left as well. Good workout!
