Today marks 6 weeks since my mosaicplasty knee surgery &#8211; time has really flown! The last two weeks in particular just seemed to fly by. Yesterday I took the bus up to see the doctor, and he was really impressed with my range of motion and how the swelling has gone down (still not completely). 

The big news is that 6 weeks means it&#8217;s WBAT time! That&#8217;s Weight-bearing as Tolerated! Dr. Grauer told me (as had my PT) that it wasn&#8217;t as though I could just throw away the crutches. It was a process to get used to putting a bit more weight on the leg as I used the crutches. In a few days I can advance to one crutch, and then finally be crutch-free. How exciting! 

He said it&#8217;ll be another few weeks until I can use the elliptical. Riding my bike outside and running will have to wait for at least another month. But this is definitely a milestone!

I was still hesitant to put much weight on it as I walked, although last night I just got used to standing on my own two feet unassisted. So strange for this to be such a big deal!

It seems perfect that this happens right at the end of July. I should be able to start driving again in a few days and I plan to head on out and get myself a month&#8217;s pass at the pool. I&#8217;m ok for swimming or pool running, so I may as well make the most of it! 

I did speak with my PT today about the [Aquabike event](http://www.invernesstriathlon.com/) I&#8217;d been eying in September, and she advised me against it. If I&#8217;ll just barely be getting used to riding outside, and won&#8217;t be able to run through transition, it&#8217;s probably a waste (not to mention, it&#8217;s a pool swim). So, I&#8217;ll save my $ and focus on what the future holds!
