Weight: 112.8

Today I picked sleep over boot camp. 

I&#8217;m actually glad to be back in the office with better food options. I&#8217;m no longer going to post supplements, just assume I take the same stuff daily.

Am: blueberry yogurt  
Breakfast: oatmeal, pb, hemp seed  
Lunch: brown rice, coconut crusted tilapia  
Pm: cottage cheese  
Pm: amazing meal drink with skim milk  
Dinner: salmon linguine with asparagus, breadsticks, 2 glasses red wine

No workout today üôÅ it was a rough day, stress-wise. The workout would probably have made a difference!
