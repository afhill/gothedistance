Entering week 4 of my 12 week Pfitz plan, and I slept in today and didn&#8217;t have time to run my scheduled run. So I went ahead and ran tomorrow&#8217;s Recovery run, and plan on running the 10 miles with 5 @ LT pace tomorrow.

It&#8217;ll be tight, I have an 8am meeting so I will probably have to start by 6 or 6:30. But as far as I&#8217;m concerned, swapping two runs within the same week doesn&#8217;t count as &#8220;missing&#8221; a workout.
