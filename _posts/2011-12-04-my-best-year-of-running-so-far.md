I set a lot of PRs this year&#8230; not just one- or two-second improvements, but BIG gains.

In 9 years (from 2001-2010), I&#8217;d only managed to shave off 21 seconds per mile (from 7:25 &#8211; 7:04). In 2011, I cut my PR by 12 seconds per mile. In December I ran a 6:28 pace on a course that was later determined to only have been 2.95 miles.

Not a distance I run frequently, but I hadn&#8217;t improved on the distance since 2006. In 2011 I cut two minutes off my overall time, or an improvement of 24 seconds per mile.

From 2004 to 2008 I saw a decent improvement of 20 seconds per mile, but that was nothing compared to the 47 second per mile improvement this year! (My 10K pace is now faster than my 5K PR pace)

</table>

The math is easy on this one. In only my third time at this distance, I shaved off 23 seconds. That&#8217;s a 15% improvement!

* Uncertified &#8211; potentially short course/all downhill.  
I did well my first half-marathon and have struggled to really see much improvement.  
From 2002 &#8211; 2006 I could only shave off a second per mile, and I ran this distance often! I made a difference in 2010 when I dropped 17 seconds per mile, and then a big leap this year when I dropped another 22 seconds per mile! (Exactly 5 minutes faster overall than the 2010 race).

I didn&#8217;t run any fast marathons this year, but I have no reason to believe I won&#8217;t also see a big improvement at that distance as well when I take it on in January. I&#8217;ve only shaved off 21 seconds per mile since my first marathon 7 years ago, and since 2005 have made negligible improvement (1 second per mile). With my shorter races all indicating better overall conditioning than the past, I&#8217;m confident I&#8217;m ripe for a big marathon PR as well. 

(In case you&#8217;re curious, I keep all my race results in a [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj6j62nW_i1kdGVRVmY1SEYyUXFlWFRudG51RDN3VkE&hl=en_US#gid=2))
