We have been referring to the spare room as &#8220;the marathon room&#8221; and it finally is starting to look as it was envisioned. The poster is from Boston 2005 &#8211; the names of all the entrants are printed in the background of the poster. The medals are from my marathons. On the other walls I have some of the plaques and trophies I&#8217;ve received. 

I have plans to also put up the poster from Boston 2006 and medals from shorter races as well. So far the kids are having a blast wearing the medals around the house as we are in the process of decorating.
