When I joined the <a href="http://www.denverrollerdolls.org" rel="nofollow">Denver Roller Dolls</a>, many of my running buddies asked if they thought it was helping my running. Actually, I think it&#8217;s moreso that my running has given me some great advantages in derby!

2) Endurance. Again &#8211; I can sustain a 174bpm heartrate for close to four hours. Our practices are &#8220;only&#8221; two hours!

3) Awareness. I realized this benefit during the Boston Marathon. When you&#8217;re running in a crowd of 20,000 runners, you&#8217;re watching for those gaps, and accelerating, decelerating and moving laterally to move forward. I think these are the same skills that help a jammer move though the pack!
