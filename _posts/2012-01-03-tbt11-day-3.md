#### Food

  * tea
  * tofu scramble with greens, tomato, mushroom, avocado. BUT! When I went to eat it, I had no bread for toast. I don&#8217;t want to be melodramatic and say this is a travesty, but this is a travesty! I eat scrambled eggs or tofu on toast. Always. So I actually had to use a fork this time. Bummer.
  * homemade kombucha
  * smoothie: greens, apple, banana, pineapple, blueberries, maca, BCAAs, creatine, wheat germ, hemp protein powder. This was right AFTER I posted a link on the TBT Facebook page about how juices with too much fructose can&#8217;t be processed by the liver. Whoops.. 
  * Black beans, brown rice, tomato, avocado in a whole wheat tortilla
  * Banana
  * Pistachios 
  * Athlete&#8217;s Honeymilk*
  * Powerbar &#8211; just looked at the ingredients. These will now become cheat day foods&#8230;
  * quinoa salad with onion, goji berries, black beans and green apples, with apple cider vinegar and lemon
  * pineapple
  * greek yogurt with muesli

#### Exercise

  * Most of the P90X Ab Ripper workout
  * 9 mile ladder run
  * Crossfit basics 2 workshop: squats. In all we did over 100 air squats (including some as a tabata workout), as well as front and overhead squats with the bar. The tabata was a good workout! 

*My rules should probably include [Athletes Honeymilk](http://www.honeymilk.com/). I love this stuff post-workout. It has 26g of protein and if you get a non-light version, there&#8217;s no added sugar. (I like the original honey flavor). I have a case of this stuff in my fridge and two more on the way &#8211; they&#8217;re pretty generous in their online contests ðŸ˜‰ I only save them for hard workouts, so generally twice a week I have them. 

Someone on the TBT page asked if they were eating too much. I said NO! I haven&#8217;t done it in awhile but I went over to Livestrong.com and put in everything I ate on their [MyPlate calculator](http://www.livestrong.com/myplate/) just to give a sense of what I was eating. It cracks me up how it freaks out about my protein consumption ðŸ™‚ Although, it ALSO seems to freak out about my fat and carb consumption&#8230;.?

WAIT! Before someone gets up in arms about that sugar thing&#8230;  
bananas &#8211; 16.6g each (I had 2)  
pineapple &#8211; 33g  
Both of those are natural sugars. The AHM also had 26g of sugar, but it claims it has a low glycemic index (as it uses honey for the sweetener, and I assume some of that sugar is lactase). Now that I look, that PB Powerbar isn&#8217;t clean, it has some &#8220;C2 Max Energy Blend&#8221; which is a bunch of sweeteners. Ugh..

But honestly, eating clean is NOT about calories. It&#8217;s really not. Do you put sugar in the gas tank of your car? Then why do you put it into your body? Give your body the fuel it needs to perform!
