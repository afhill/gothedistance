Every marathoner has this experience: your training is coming along, you&#8217;re running strong and eager for what race day will bring. Then one day there&#8217;s a little niggle here, or you&#8217;re particularly tired the day after a run. Then another. It becomes harder to hit those target paces that you were acing so recently. Your mind starts to plant little seeds of doubt. 

Thankfully, most of the time this sense of &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait for this stupid race to be over&#8221; happens right around taper time. And that&#8217;s what taper is for! To give you time to heal and focus, with the hard work behind you. 

Except&#8230; it&#8217;s not time for me to taper yet!

My goal race is Oct 21st, but I&#8217;ve been dragging for close to two weeks now. I&#8217;m just mentally ready for a break. Even my recovery runs require a little mental &#8220;heave-HO!&#8221; for me to step out the door, and then it takes a few steps for me to fall into my stride. 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/monthlymiles-300x224.png" alt="" title="monthlymiles" width="300" height="224" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4269" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/monthlymiles.png)I&#8217;m trying my hardest not to let my training slack off: I&#8217;ve pushed hard this year through working with a club, increasing my mileage and improving my running economy and speed. But running is HARD right now! I&#8217;ve even tried dropping my mileage to get some sense of recovery, but to seemingly no avail. (Even with one dramatic and one partial cutback week, this was my month of highest mileage ever), which included two back-to-back weeks of my highest mileage in at least 6 months. 

I blame my shoes to some extent: I think I let them go on too long so I&#8217;m replacing them and also going to start to be better about rotating them. Using a single pair when you&#8217;re running 3x/week is pretty different than when you&#8217;re running 6-7x/week! 

I just hope I snap out of this funk soon!
