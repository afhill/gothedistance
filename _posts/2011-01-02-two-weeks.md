Tonight on the phone my Mom said that in two weeks, our AZ race would be done. Two weeks? Wow, where did the time go?

Although I haven&#8217;t been completely faithful to my training plan as of late, I&#8217;m feeling pretty good. Last week I went out for a run and pulled off 10 miles @ 7:50 without having any intention to do so. Today I did 10 miles outside, a quarter mile on a crazy incline on the treadmill (I think at least 5% grade) and then another 1.75 miles. Then I remembered I had roller derby practice later in the day and figured I should give my legs a rest.

Derby went fine, in some of the agility things (jumping and stepping over cones) I felt my legs were a bit tired, but overall I felt strong.

This week I&#8217;m back to work and I anticipate I&#8217;ll be able to get back into my morning workouts to finish my training strong. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve shared my goal: it&#8217;s a 3:40:59 &#8211; a Boston Qualifying time. Although I don&#8217;t plan to run Boston again anytime soon, it&#8217;s a good even goal to shoot for. Hard to believe I haven&#8217;t run that pace for nearly two years. Although I haven&#8217;t done as many long runs as I could have, I feel pretty good with the speedwork I&#8217;ve been doing.
