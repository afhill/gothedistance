Honestly, I need to stop commenting on how I don&#8217;t feel run down. I had trouble falling asleep last night and today woke up with an incredibly sore throat. Ugh. 

We had our first snowfall of the season, so it was actually a great excuse to be inside. 

Food  
&#8211; Starbucks non-fat chai. I thought it was a great day for a relaxing walk through the falling snow to get a warm beverage  
&#8211; Banana  
&#8211; odwalla green monster drink  
&#8211; toasted English muffin with almond butter  
&#8211; vega sports performance protein with creatine and BCAAs  
&#8211; black bean chili with sesame flatbread  
&#8211; emergen-c  
&#8211; fresh squeezed OJ  
&#8211; apple  
&#8211; superfood slam probar  
&#8211; banana, almond butter and hemp seed in a whole wheat tortilla

Exercise  
&#8211; legs: squats, leg press, lunges. I tried leg extensions but I fatigued quickly. Granted, I did it AFTER the other stuff.  
&#8211; kettlebell class

It should have been a run day today, but I just didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to put in a quality workout. Tomorrow!
