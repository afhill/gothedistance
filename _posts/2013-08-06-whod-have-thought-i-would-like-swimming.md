It&#8217;s August 6, and I&#8217;ve been to the pool 4 times this month. I bought a 30 day pass on Aug 2nd and plan to make the most of it!

I don&#8217;t do a ton while I&#8217;m there &#8211; the workouts friends have been sending me are completely wasted so far. ðŸ™‚ I am still doing some basic drills to help with balance and breathing. I do a little, and then I&#8217;m done for the day so I don&#8217;t learn bad habits or get frustrated. And I see progress from day to day! I&#8217;m still focusing on REALLY basic things, like remembering to breathe out through my nose. But every day gets easier and I&#8217;ve gotten past those fears of getting water up my nose (Which is HUGE for me!) I can&#8217;t quite get normal swim breathing down, but I feel like I&#8217;m close and it&#8217;ll come in the next few days. 

Every trip has also included some time walking in the lazy river in the leisure pool, which has been great in helping my walking improve. Those jets are no joke! 

I have a weird balance when it comes to skill development. I HATE not knowing what to do and feeling like a loser. But I love learning. So being able to just show up and work on a little piece and figure it out has actually been fun and rewarding. I can see the progress I&#8217;ve made, even though I know I have a long way to go. Good thing I have a month&#8217;s pool pass! I feel pretty confident that at the end of that I&#8217;ll be okay swimming with other people ðŸ™‚
