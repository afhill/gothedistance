I had 6 miles on my training plan today anyway so I decided this was a good substitute.

So maybe doing legs at the gym yesterday and having beer and gyros for dinner wasn&#8217;t the best preparation. Couple that with the chilly course (I was one of perhaps 10 people wearing shorts), and it was not my day.

1 &#8211; 7:46  
2 &#8211; 8:10  
3 &#8211; 7:59  
4 &#8211; 8:18  
5 &#8211; 8:30  
6 &#8211; 7:39  
.2 &#8211; 7:05pace  
&#8212;&#8211;  
50:25 (8:07 pace)

I stuck around afterwards for the awards, and determined that had I wanted hardware, I should have just run the 5K. The winning time was 25:10, and I know I hit the turn around before the girl who placed second finished. Sigh.. It&#8217;s funny how that happens sometimes, when the faster runners choose the longer course. In the end, I placed 5th female, 2nd in my AG (10-year AGs)

The course was on cement most of the way, and I&#8217;ll admit that the downhills were a little rough on my quads. Just a reminder to me that not everything is going to be on my nice flat soft track at the gym!

It was still a good day to run: the sun is shining, there isn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky. Now it&#8217;s off to relax and enjoy the rest of Thanksgiving (and prepare mentally for the 20 miler this weekend!)

Oh &#8211; and for those of you who think Garmins are perfect, here&#8217;s the elevation chart from the race. This was a two-lap course so really it should show the same elevation graph twice. It&#8217;s close, but not quite. That&#8217;s why I use it for a guide, but don&#8217;t get too wrapped up in it.
