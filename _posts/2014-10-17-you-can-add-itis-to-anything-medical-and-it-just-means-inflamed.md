I&#8217;ve been suffering with an annoying sore throat for about a week now. This morning I woke up and it was a struggle to swallow. All my wellness remedy, ACV drinking, garlic-chomping hasn&#8217;t seemed to help. So I headed to the Urgent Care close to work. 

No strep. I asked the PA &#8211; what about tonsilitis? Anything that I can get something for? He gave me a bit of a smurk and told me &#8220;you can add -itis to anything medical, and it just means inflamed. So sure you have tonsilitis. But it&#8217;s viral, you just need for it to run its course.&#8221;

&#8220;but it&#8217;s been 7 days!&#8221;

&#8220;it could be 7 days, it could be 5 weeks&#8221;

This guy was not becoming my friend. 

I told him I had a marathon in 16 days and he actually told me to keep training. And finally he relented and gave me a script for prednisone. At least something that may help!

Yeah, training hasn&#8217;t been great this past week or so. I missed my 20 and I havent had a ton of energy. 

Part of that could be this bug I&#8217;m fighting off, but I realized it could be something else too. 

Last week I started using the MyFitnessPal app. Frida is using it as part of her latest tbt, and I do like the accountability of sharing what I take in. So I started. You put in whatever you eat and it spits out calories, nutritional breakdown, etc. 

It seemed pretty cool &#8211; it models what you&#8217;re eating and tells you what the impact could be on your weight. Race day is coming up, and that stuff does matter, so I played around with it a bit and played with my goal caloric intake. And then my willpower kicked in, so I was a perfect eater for those first 4 days .. apart from the day where I ate normal but ran 10 miles and the system yelled at me for not eating enough that day. But I sorta ignored it, assuming I&#8217;d make it up on other days when I was hungry. 

But &#8211; the system accounts for things per day. So just because I was low on the 13th, the system still gave me my normal allotment on the 14th. So I was in a really bad caloric rut all week.

Then yesterday we did a health screening and I was all good except for my blood pressure, which was high (something like 140-89 and 132-98). It&#8217;s been borderline high before but this was the first time it actually went into high. The bummer is that all the ways to manage bp are things I already do: dont smoke, I&#8217;m active and maintain a healthy weight. :-/

Today I got up nice and early but felt like crud b/c of my throat and then started to run and didnt feel like it and was just out of sorts. And then I got to work and they were giving away Duffyrolls (these pastry-like cinnamon rolls) and I had two. Right there was close to 50% of my daily caloric intake goal. No joke.  
Then I went to urgent care, as I mentioned. And they took my bp. 122-82. Which is totally fine. Huh. Ok, so duffyrolls calm me down?? 

Unless of course the caloric deficit WAS actually causing me stress. I also went out at lunch and had a great 5 mile run &#8211; in something like 42 min (8:24 pace). Huh. So yeah, I&#8217;m not so sure about this calorie tracking thing. I guess its interesting to be aware of what you&#8217;re taking in, but I don&#8217;t think I am the sort of person who should set a goal with it.

It&#8217;s funny, too, why am I worrying about changing stuff up with two weeks to go? Sure, getting down to the weight I was when I ran my best marathon would be great, but not at the expense of compromising my immune system and not letting me actually train..!
