It&#8217;s marathon #16 or 17, Boston #3, and yet I am soo excited for this weekend! I&#8217;m giddy and eager to set foot in Beantown. The weather in Columbus has been nice lately, and I hope it will be so there as well. 

The women&#8217;s olympic marathon trials are going on Sunday, so I hope to watch some of the country&#8217;s fastest women fly by, and then see how Monday goes for me.

I feel as though I&#8217;ll run a much stronger race than I have in the past. In both the past two times I&#8217;ve run Boston, I&#8217;ve suffered with going out too quickly and fading. I really hope to keep that in check this time. Hopefully the thought that the Flying Pig is only a couple weeks away will &#8220;encourage&#8221; responsible running. 

There will be a report from the road, I&#8217;m sure!
