Yup, it&#8217;s taper time. Which means I havent even completed this race, and I&#8217;m looking to the next one. My friend KJ and I are looking to do Rock n Roll Arizona. I focused on just getting the miles in for New York, but I&#8217;m ready to push the pace a bit for the next one. 

I had good success with the Run Less, Run Faster Plan in the past, so I&#8217;m going to try to get back into it. It&#8217;s a bit daunting to work out all the target paces, and I suspect the treadmill at work is going to become a good friend over the winter! I know that isn&#8217;t the best way to ensure I can keep the pace up, but it helps me hone in (and let&#8217;s be honest, it&#8217;s realistic to consider I can actually get the runs in without it being too cold and dark). 

I only have like 10 weeks before the races, so it&#8217;ll start soon! Looking forward to feeling fast again!
