Yesterday was my first day of my Pfitzinger 55/12 training schedule &#8211; 8 miles general aerobic with 10x 100m strides. I realized about the 6th stride that I was doing .1mi strides, not 100metres.. about 40% longer than I was supposed to! However, my fitsense measures long, so it was probably not too far off.

Today is &#8216;rest or cross-train&#8217; day, so that&#8217;s easy! I haven&#8217;t been cross-training much at all, so I&#8217;m planning on going to the gym to bike for an hour or so. it&#8217;s also a good excuse to start reading Harry Potter!

I would love to do a 3:30 this fall&#8230; we&#8217;ll see!
