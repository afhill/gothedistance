Yesterday we did a series of exercises with a medicine ball. 

>   * 5 rounds for time: 
>       * 10 medicine ball squat cleans
>       * 10 medicine ball sit-ups
>       * 10 medicine ball burpees

It was a good workout, a good range of exercises. I finished only a few seconds behind the Crazfit girl &#8211; I rock some crossfit burpees! (I&#8217;ve mastered the &#8216;throwing yourself down onto your chest&#8217; technique). 

Afterwards for &#8220;dessert&#8217; we did some different core work with the medicine balls: crunches with the ball sitting on your legs, etc. We were to do each exercise for a minute, and if you couldn&#8217;t make it through the minute you had to switch to pushups.  
Afterwards I grabbed the bar and worked on my bench press (just with the bar). Wanna keep working on that for next Spring! 

I think Loren and I are going to do &#8220;Murph&#8221; on Monday&#8230; Im looking forward to it!
