Wow, three weeks, how crazy!

On a recommendation by Melissa, I started using a site to track my food. That way I get a more holistic view of my intake. Since I was already looking up a lot on Livestrong.com, I went ahead and started using their site (plus, they have an iphone app ðŸ™‚

The site is very easy to use, and I love how many common products are in there. You can also save entire meals to add again and again (for example, I have about two different menus for breakfast).

I was actually really amused: by lunchtime, my daily protein and fiber intake numbers were red, apparently I had exceeded the recommended amount? It just goes to show you how important it is to know your goals: it stated I should only be getting 50g of protein a day!

There is also a fun chart that shows your ratio of carbs:proteins:fats and until dinner I had a nice 49%-25%-25% split. Then I enjoyed almond butter with dinner and it totally changed the ratio to almost exactly 33%-33%-33%. Crazy! Then I snacked after dinner and the ratio slid back to 53%-23%-23%. My evening snacks were HORRIBLE: a probar and a starbucks chai, which accounted for over 2/3rds of all my day&#8217;s sugar intake. No wonder it&#8217;s 12:30am and I&#8217;m sitting here on the computer.. I just need to be smarter that that.

I had some really great exercise today: went to PT this morning, then bootcamp after work and THEN 2 hours of derby practice where I participated in almost all the drills. Bootcamp was fun: we did 4x(30 tricep dips, 30 weird squat things , 15 pushups, 30 snowboarder sprawls, 30 lunges). Officially the workout had 30 pushups but there was a modified version for each. I only did the modification for the pushups. I flew through the exercises in less than a half hour! Then surprisingly I wasn&#8217;t too beat up for practice! I am definitely feeling good and strong!

Oh wait, you read this to actually see what I&#8217;m eating? Well [here&#8217;s my livestrong &#8216;food diary&#8217;](http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/diary/who/afhill)
