Watching some inspirational running movie or reading a running book is one of my pre-race rituals. Generally I do it the night before the race, but there was a showing of &#8220;[There is no Finish Line: The Joan Benoit-Samuelson Story](http://thereisnofinishline.net/)&#8221; at a local theatre last night, so I got a chance to get in my inspiration early. 

The film was preceded by two others, one about a Colorado College coach and another about the Mt. Washington Road Race. Because this is Boulder, they&#8217;d invite people from the audience who had some sort of personal experience with the event or people in the film. For example, they invited [Sage Canaday](http://sagecanaday.com/) to come down and speak about his experiences with Mt. Washington (you know, the guy who holds the American record on the course?) I also spotted Scott Jurek in the lobby. Yup, this is Boulder&#8230;

Anyway, the movie. &#8220;There is No Finish Line&#8221; was really well done, there were some great one-liners that had the audience cracking up, plus some points where I got a bit emotional. The title &#8220;There is no finish line&#8221; was something Joanie repeated several times in the film, about how there are always future goals for you to set for yourself. You can always keep improving and striving and finding purpose in what you do. 

The film is available for purchase from the website, or digitally via iTunes. It was definitely inspiring and has me even MORE excited for Sunday, if that&#8217;s possible! Joan has achieved amazing things (first woman to break 3hrs in the marathon in FIVE DIFFERENT DECADES), but she came across as just a regular ole person who works hard and is fueled by passion. We may not all be able to perform as she has, but we all have passion and drive, and a love for this sport.
