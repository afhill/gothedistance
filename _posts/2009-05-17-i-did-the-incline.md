Today I headed to Manitou Springs to meet the Incline Club for a long run. Shortly before I arrived, I started feeling a bit &#8220;off&#8221;, and I had the feeling it wasn&#8217;t going to be a great running day. 

The official run planned was the Ute Pass Trail-Waldo-LRR double (yes, that&#8217;s three things, I don&#8217;t pretend to understand). We started off, and within the first three miles on the trail I was struggling pretty badly, my stomach was giving me problems when I tried to run. I decided to turn around, but it was too gorgeous a day not to be outside enjoying it. I turned my sights towards **the Incline**.

Officially, the Incline is private property, and by climbing it you&#8217;re trespassing. But that doesn&#8217;t stop folks from running&#8230; well, scrambling.. well, trudging up the 5000 steps. The average grade is just over 40%, and the steepest point tops out at 68%. Yes, at some point I had my hands on the railways ties ahead of me to literally climb! 

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/p_incline1-300x140.gif" alt="incline" title="incline" width="300" height="140" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-952" />](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/p_incline1.gif)A single mile, and yet you see people stopping to rest as they &#8220;hike&#8221; the Incline. I kept myself moving forward save for one break 2/3rds of the way up. The secret of the Incline is that the top is actually a false summit, so you climb as far as you can see&#8230;and then keep going! 

According to the elevation chart, the Incline is 1.02miles long. I had my garmin on, and it came in at .82, so I&#8217;m not sure how the measurement works (I started my watch at the base of the stairs, and stopped it as I got off the stairs). One of the Incline club guys told me he&#8217;d completed the Incline in 29 minutes last Saturday: even with turning my watch off for my break, it took me 39:10 to cover the distance! (Average heart rate &#8211; 164bpm). Once at the top and finding out there was in fact no free beer (hey, one can hope!), I headed back down the trail at a much more acceptable pace. By this time my stomach was better so while I didn&#8217;t run to set any records, I was able to make it back down to the parking lot in an overall time of 1:04:49 for 3.29 miles. Wow, that&#8217;s kinda funny to think about. 

So now the bar is set and I can have a goal for next time!
