This morning I woke up to go volunteer at the [Polar Bear 5K](http://www.bkbltd.com/RUNDENVER.htm). I had registered to run but since I&#8217;m still in recovery, I decided to help out. For some reason, I was given the staff instruction to come at 7:30 instead of 8:30. It was COLD and WINDY. We actually had to take down the tents because one blew away as we were setting them up. It was somewhat miserable but I was glad to help support my sport! After setup and registration, I went and manned a water stop. One guy ran by and said &#8220;thanks Andrea!&#8221; (Although he didn&#8217;t pronounce my name as I do). I didn&#8217;t recognize him, odd&#8230; afterwards he came over and said that he remembered me from the last race, we&#8217;d been close and then I outkicked him at the end. He&#8217;d obviously looked me up afterwards! We chatted a bit about training/racing strategies. 

I came home, had a quick bath to warm up, then hit the gym. I tried out a new crazy workout approach: Dramatic Transformation Principle. I wrote [a whole post about it](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/dramatic-transformation-principle/ "Dramatic Transformation Principle"), but suffice to say in total I did 310 chest-supported incline rows. Yowza! 

After that, I went to check out AllSports Recovery Club in Boulder. I&#8217;m just so intrigued by this idea of a post-workout recovery club. I ALSO [blogged about that](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/allsports-recovery-club-only-in-boulder/ "AllSports Recovery Club .. only in Boulder"), so I won&#8217;t repeat myself. But it did involve hanging upside down like a bat, and using a laser on myself. 

Tired of narrative? Here&#8217;s the deets:

#### Food

&#8211; quinoa, almond milk, cinnamon  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; PROBAR  
&#8211; coffee (with hot chocolate. I JUST realized this was a cheat. dangit.)  
&#8211; veggie juice: celery, carrots, spinach, a tiny bit of kale, beets, cucumber, apple. I meant to put in ginger root, but I forgot. I did have to add water because my poor blender motor was crying. Then it was super thick, so I ended up straining it through a colander. I guess this is why people buy juicers&#8230; It was definitely refreshing though. I&#8217;m trying to have more veggies and less fruit to moderate my fructose intake.  
&#8211; Vega pre-sports optimizer with creatine and BCAAs  
&#8211; Vega sports protein with creatine and BCAAs  
&#8211; homemade protein bar  
&#8211; green curry with tofu and brown rice  
&#8211; more veggie juice!  
&#8211; spinach salad with cucumbers, bean sprouts, tomatoes and hemp seed with [red pepper, chickpea and tahini dressing](http://www.choosingraw.com/creamy-red-pepper-chickpea-and-tahini-dressing/). I didnt have smoked paprika, so I used regular and a bit of turmeric. After tasting the dressing, I realized it&#8217;s essentially just watered down hummus&#8230; I&#8217;m okay with that.  
&#8211; toasted Ezekiel english muffin with peanut butter and hemp seed. Mmm.. protein
