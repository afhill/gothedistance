&#8220;DU or not DU. There is no TRI.&#8221;

These are the sorts of words of wisdom I come up with after 12 miles. Someone asked Doug about his recent triathlon, to which he replied he&#8217;s done a DU, not a TRI. 

I want to market it to a duathlon RD. Can you imagine little shirts with yoda in bike shorts??? Although my friends cautioned me to ensure I had a copyright lawyer at the ready&#8230;.
