incredibly, I just had a successful treadmill run!

Secrets:  
1. appropriate music (blaring missy elliott and ciara is essential)  
2. starting slow

the music entices you to speed up, but so long as you&#8217;re willing to start slow and return to slow, you don&#8217;t get discouraged.

I told myself I&#8217;d run for an hour. At the end of the hour, I&#8217;d done 6.7 miles, so I took a water break and went back for another half hour. I then figured it would be around that same length of time to do 3.3 miles, and get in an even 10, so that&#8217;s what I did.

I ended up doing 10 miles at just under an hour and a half, which is a respectable 9 min mile. Often when I start on the treadmill I push it up to at least 8:20 right from the start, and get overheated and frustrated. This felt really good, the whole way!
