The bike I bought off eBay arrived today! And thankfully I have handy friends, so Eddie came over after work and we put it together, and then he took her on her maiden voyage down the street (I&#8217;m still too nervous).

It&#8217;s a 2010 Felt S32 Tri bike, with upgraded aerobars, shifters and wheels. Supposedly the previous owner rode it ~500 miles on the trainer and ~200 miles in races. (Pretty sure I&#8217;ll put more miles on it this year!). It has a few marks from some type of collision, but nothing a bit of black paint shouldn&#8217;t fix. I&#8217;m going to try it out with the Cobb Gen 2 saddle.

There are some adjustments to be made: the shipper only sent one skewer so I grabbed one from my roommate&#8217;s bike and will need to swap it out. Also, the cassette is on the race wheels (tubulars, unfortunately) , not the training wheels. And of course I need to figure out the fit, but I&#8217;ll wait until I can walk into a shop, clip into the pedals, and have that done (i.e. August).

So excited! I&#8217;m disappointed I just have to look longingly at the bike for a little while, but it&#8217;s just exciting to have it!
