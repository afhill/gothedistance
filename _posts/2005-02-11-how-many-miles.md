Lately I&#8217;ve been reading a bunch of different training plans, etc. I can&#8217;t imagine all those people who run like 70 miles a week &#8211; I&#8217;ve heard about the Pfitzinger 55 mpw plan, and even that seems crazy to me. It&#8217;s interesting though, I can&#8217;t help but wonder how that could improve my running  
I feel a bit silly about it to some extent, like maybe I&#8217;m trying too hard or something. I mentioned it to Andy, and he said he just runs, doesn&#8217;t worry about all that. I almost feel like maybe I&#8217;m making too big a deal out of all this, but at the same time, I want to push my limits, see what all I can do  
This week was a bad running week for me, I just didn&#8217;t have much motivation or energy. I wasn&#8217;t particularly sore after Sunday (I had a few twinges on Tuesday, but not too bad), but I don&#8217;t know if I just needed a mental break. I&#8217;m running alot more than I did last year, maybe it&#8217;s catching up on me. How funny is it that 30 miles a week is alot more than summer, but it is. My average was 24 miles or something leading up to the marathon. Again, with all the reading I&#8217;ve been doing, most people wouldn&#8217;t have even said I was ready to run it. So maybe I do have to just ignore what I read  
Because supposedly Meredith and I train too hard, too. When we run on the weekends, we&#8217;re pushing close to marathon pace. I like it, because I feel like I&#8217;m getting used to it. I do understand what the literature says about not pushing too hard, though. Maybe I managed it over the summer because I was taking so many days off for recovery, who knows&#8230;.
