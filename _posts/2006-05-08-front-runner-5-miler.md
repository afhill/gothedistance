Yesterday was the Front Runner 5Miler. I ran into Doug at the starting line, and told him I wanted to run a 7:30 pace (finish in 37:30). Being the excellent running partner he is, he watched his watch and pushed me through some rough spots.

The first mile we ran against the wind a bit, and I felt we were both breathing a bit hard. We hit the first mile marker, and Doug looked at his watch. &#8220;Time?&#8221; I asked him. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to know&#8230;&#8221;, he replied &#8220;&#8230;7:05!&#8221;. I believe I called him a jerk at that point! So we slowed down a bit, and Doug even requested we stop to grab water during the 2nd mile. So we did, and our time at the 2nd mile marker was 14:51 (7:25), pretty close to back on target.

It was rather cold and windy, and the course seemed to just go out further and further, I was looking forward to turning around. It&#8217;s so strange how I can go on and on at an 8 minute mile in a marathon, but much faster just wipes me out. Finally we hit the third mile marker at 22:02 (7:21). We hit the fourth mile marker, and I felt myself struggling. Doug rtied to encourage me, saying that this was no worse than mile 24 at Boston, with only two miles left. We then turned a corner and were hit with a blast of wind. I told him that actually, yes, it was worse. (I was kidding &#8212; kinda)

We stopped for another water break, and 5 or 6 people passed us. &#8220;Well, &#8221; I told Doug, &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll just have to pass them back&#8221; &#8211; which is what we did. I know that he was definitely pulling me along at this time. We hit the 5th mile marker and he said that we just needed a 7:35 to pull off my goal time. I surmised that the last mile must have been about 7:35, and since that one involved a water stop, and felt like crap, the last mile would be easy. 

Much of the last mile was against the wind, but it was the last mile, so it was manageable. As I hit the final corner to turn into the parking lot and the finish, Amber was there cheering me on. I passed her and saw the finish clock looming up ahead, closing in on 37 minutes. I kicked it up a bit, and to my surprise, Doug told me to go for it (I had felt I was holding him back so I was surprised he didnt pick it up). I crossed the line just passed 37 minute (Doug said his watch said 37:03, my official posted time was 37:05) &#8212; for a 7:25 overall pace. Hurrah for meeting goals!

I stuck around afterwards and talked with Deb Wilch and another Team Run Wild member, then eventually we made our way over to the awards tent where Doug picked up 1st in his age group and I got third. Not too shabby! I&#8217;m sure glad Doug was there though to help me push ym way through the rough spots. I can do it, I just need to be williing to work for it!

oh! and my bio is up on the team run wild website at http://runwildracing.com/TeamRunWild.asp?nTRWID=2 and so far I&#8217;m first in my age group for Grant Prix standings.. http://runwildracing.com/GPResultsDetail.asp?strFirstName=Andrea&strLastName=Hill&nSumOfGPScore=175&nPosition=1
