Hobbling on crutches isn&#8217;t easy or enjoyable, but you can help prepare yourself with a little pre-surgery physical therapy.

I went through physical therapy for left hip bursitis in 2011, and much of the strength I developed at that time has been key in managing being non-weight-bearing on my right side years later.

Since you can&#8217;t anticipate which leg or knee you may injure, I recommend doing unilateral exercises as part of your regular routine. This will also help you in times on wellness as well as injury, of course!

Here&#8217;s the two must-do exercises that&#8217;ll support your recovery just as much as those crutches!

1. Single leg squats, a.k.a. Pistols. These are pretty hardcore exercises that can be a good challenge to attempt to master all on their own. Stand on one leg with your other leg extended straight in front of you, and lower yourself down until your extended leg is parallel to the floor and only a few feet above it. Then without touching down, push yourself back up to standing. Ill admit, I never mastered this on my left leg, but it&#8217;s something I have worked on.  
**Why it&#8217;s key:** two words: toilet seat.

2. Single leg Romanian deadlifts. When I performed these in PT, I actually had to place the weight down at different angles in front of me to further work on my balance.  
**Why it&#8217;s key:** picking things up.

I had originally planned on making a Top 5 list, but nothing else I could think of compared to these two. So if you think surgery may be in your future, or even if not, spend some time on these!
