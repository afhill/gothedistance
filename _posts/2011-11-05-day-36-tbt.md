I had my alarm set for 5:45 this morning to go meet a running group, and blissfully woke up on my own at 5:40. I love not being abruptly woken up!

&#8211; fresh-squeezed orange juice  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; clif bar

Exercise  
&#8211; another [great run](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/11/speedy-saturday/) with the Running Republic of Boulder. Total: 10.06 miles in 1:22
