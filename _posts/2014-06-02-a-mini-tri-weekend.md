Kinda, sorta&#8230;

Saturday I rode 20 miles on my tribike, then another 4 on my roadbike just around town.  
Sunday morning I went up to Brainard Lake Rec Area and ran 5 miles up at 10K feet. Then I came home and did a SHORT swim at Scott Carpenter Pool, and then rode about 5 miles on my road bike to the grocery store and back. So over the course of the weekend I did all three sports, but with plenty of time in between. 

Why is this relevant, since I&#8217;ve very obviously not been focused on triathlon lately? Well, Yi-nan brought it up again for a late summer goal. maybe&#8230;. although that swim thing definitely needs more help. I feel as though I&#8217;ve forgotten most of what I covered in my lessons üôÅ
