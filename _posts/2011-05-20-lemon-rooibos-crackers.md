I used to be a cracker-a-holic. In high school, I&#8217;d sometimes just eat an entire sleeve of ritz crackers for my lunch. (Seriously, my eating habits have never been good, it&#8217;s sorta amazing to see the change to present day). Now, though, I&#8217;m trying to eat healthier, and regular crackers seem often to be empty carbs with additives. 

Today I made a recipe from the Thrive book: lemon rooibos crackers. Delish! They were incredibly flavorful and didn&#8217;t need anything with them. 

1/4 cup almonds  
1/4 cup pecans (I used hazelnuts b/c I had them on hand)  
1/4 cup sesame seeds  
3 tbsp fresh lemon juice  
1 tbsp lemon zest  
1 tsp ground rooibos  
1 tbsp coconut oil  
1/2 tsp agave nectar (I used coconut nectar for the coconut oil and agave)

Throw it in the food processor, then spread on a baking sheet and cook for 30 minutes. Done. Turns out 30 min was a little long and they got a little brown around the edges, but they were incredibly tasty! I never cease to be amazed by all almonds can do.
