215.15 miles for March. That includes one race (the Arnold 5K), and running daily. I&#8217;ll admit, I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure I&#8217;d make it last week when I was sick, but I pulled through. I was a bit stiff after my 20 miler on Saturday, but the last couple easy runs I&#8217;ve done have felt fine. Tomorrow I have some speedwork but on the whole, I feel in pretty good shape!
