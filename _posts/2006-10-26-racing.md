I swear, it is like a drug! I am so antsy to get out thee and race again. I know that they advise waiting, recovering, basking in your accomplishment, yet it is such a rush, I just want to get right back out there and have another increidble experience!

After my first marathon, I took recovery time. It was an even 26 days before I ran more than 3 miles at a time. I was sore!! But now, I don&#8217;t know, maybe I don&#8217;t push myself hard enough, but I feel ready to get out there and try again!!!
