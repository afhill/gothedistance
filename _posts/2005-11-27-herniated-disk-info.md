**What can be done for the pain of a herniated disk?**  
Sometimes stretching of the spine, by your doctor or a chiropractor, can help the pain.

**Will exercises help the pain?**  
Yes, exercises can be helpful. Begin by stretching. Bend over forward and bend to the sides. Start these exercises after your back is a little stronger and doesn&#8217;t hurt as much. The goal of exercise is to make your back and stomach muscles stronger. This will ease the pressure on your disk and make you hurt less. Ask your doctor about exercises for your back. Your doctor may want you to see a physical therapist to learn about safe back exercises.

**What are my chances of getting better?**  
Your chances are good. Most people with a herniated disk are better in about 4 weeks. Sometimes it takes longer. If you still have pain or numbness after 4 to 6 weeks, or if your signs get worse, talk with your doctor. Sometimes it takes surgery to relieve pain.

You know, the more I read, the more I think this may not be my problem. Or at least, it&#8217;s certianly not as serious as Cheryl made it out to be! Her problem may have been that she waited along time before doing anything about it. She also recommended I work on core strengthening exercices, so I&#8217;ll go ahead and do that..
