#### Exercise

Went for a nice run with my friend Michael, who lives in Seattle. He&#8217;s training for a half-marathon and had 9 miles on his schedule for the day. He came to the hotel and we ran the ~4.67 miles to the Fremont market. We wandered a bit, and he showed me the [Fremont rocket](http://www.fremontseattle.com/storyrocket.html), the [center of the universe](http://www.fremontseattle.com/centeroftheuniverse.html) and the [troll](http://www.fremontseattle.com/fremonttroll.html). And, he wanted to take me to the [Theo chocolate factory](http://www.theochocolate.com/). Theo is the &#8220;only fair-trade, organic, bean-to-bar chocolate factory in the United States&#8221;. And they have free samples. At first I said it wasn&#8217;t my cheat day, and then I decided that the circumstances warranted my trying it. My favorite was the [Coconut curry](https://www.theochocolate.com/store/products/chocolate-bars/fantasy-flavors/coconut-curry)! I actually bought a few bars, which I then had to carry on the run back! The run back was nice, though I was feeling the effects of the game the night before and not having run a ton lately. It was really great to see Michael though and visit. He and I used to run together after work when we were still in Ohio. We got a bit turned around on the way back, and at one point I stopped my watch and forgot to start it again so I can only estimate that the run ended up around 9.5 or 10 miles. For the part I did time, we were running at an 8:45 clip. Nice! 

So, I&#8217;m not quite sure what to do about my chocolate consumption. If I shrug it off, or take this as my cheat day for this week. It wasn&#8217;t a horrible cheat, but part of me likes to stay honest!
