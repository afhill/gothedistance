Today was a crazy day: had a 6am flight so I set my alarm for 3am. No workout for me!

Am supplements: bazi, Lifiber with apple juice, iron, adrenal supplement, glucosamine, one-a-day, b-force, salmon oil, hemp seed oil.  
Breakfast: pear  
Am: ginger ale, whole foods bar &#8211; almond butter  
Lunch: spinach and potato dosa  
Pm: non-fat latte (I wanted chai, they were out), almond crunch  
Dinner: grilled chicken salad  
Pm supplements: Lifiber with apple juice, b-force, salmon oil

I haven&#8217;t been taking bazi regularly, but I think it was a good choice today. I was able to sleep on the plane but was surprised that my energy level was as high as it was today. I did go for that latte, but that was in part just an excuse to get out of the office after a 2.5hr meeting.  
I&#8217;ve been impressed how my &#8220;sweetness&#8221; cravings have really finished. 

I&#8217;ve definitely felt a bit sluggish and, well, flabby this week. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because of the less-than-healthy food choices I made this weekend (bean enchiladas, a Chicago-style hot dog and pork schnitzel!), or the fact I&#8217;ve done basically no cardio or what. But tomorrow I&#8217;m off to the doc so we&#8217;ll see how that fares.
