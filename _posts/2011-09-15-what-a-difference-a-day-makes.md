Yesterday&#8217;s run was a struggle. I was set to do:

1 mile easy,  
2 miles @ 7:13,  
1 mile easy,  
2 miles @ 7:13,  
1 mile easy. 

Before I&#8217;d even gone a mile, I felt how elevated my heart rate was, and just wasn&#8217;t feeling well. I tried to push through the workout as best I could, but I missed my paces. 

I&#8217;ve been feeling a bit weak since I was sick this weekend, so I stopped at the store and got some protein shakes and have been trying to get some of my strength back. 

And then, today was a new day! I didn&#8217;t have a run on the schedule, but there was a casual &#8220;Rock n Roll Retro Fun Run&#8221; pretty close to my neighbourhood. I actually dug myself out from under the mountains of work I&#8217;ve been buried under, and headed over. 

It had rained earlier, so the chalk marking the course had washed away so they had to just tell us the directions. We started out and I made my way up to the front of the pack pretty quickly. Soon it was just a couple guys dressed up (possibly associated with the event?), a guy in a Boston Marathon 2011 shirt, and me leading the way. We ran the few blocks they told us, and before we knew it, we were done! Umm&#8230; according to my watch, the 5K was actually 1.17 miles! So, I high-fived the other runners, saying we&#8217;d set a world record (it was 7:55). Then after explaining to one of the volunteers how short the course was, the guys decided to go run another loop. So I started my watch again, and set off. Then after the second loop I was still feeling good, and decided to make an honest 5K out of it. 

Maybe it was the fact it was cooler than it&#8217;s been in months, maybe it was just the joy of NOT trying to hit a certain pace, who knows, but I FLEW. I didnt even truly feel like I was pushing myself as hard as I could have. 

But then I hit 3.1 miles, and stopped my watch: 20:55. 

That, ladies and gentlemen, would have been a PR on a measured course. 

So I grabbed my goody bag, feeling strong and content with a good run (but not nearly as winded as I did when I actually ran my 5K PR earlier this year). I chatted with the guy with the Boston marathon shirt (who thinks I&#8217;ll be able to qualify for New York in a few weeks) for a bit, then turned to run back home, my feet seeming to barely touch the ground as I floated home after a great run. 

Compared, yesterday and today. Note my heart rate is really relatively close on the two days, but the pace is VERY different!

One possible explanation..? A friend of mine has said that when she did high school sports, often the girls did really well the first day of their period. Well, I started the day of the Pikes Peak marathon, and then tonight. Both days I ran really strong.. who knows!
