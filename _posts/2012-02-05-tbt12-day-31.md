#### Food

&#8211; Ezekiel English muffin with almond butter and hemp seed  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; honeymilk  
&#8211; coffee (I needed to kill some time after the run and before AllSports opened, and also to change clothes)  
&#8211; superpump max – 2 scoops (still haven’t felt that same rush as the first time I used it)  
&#8211; monster aminos  
&#8211; warm quinoa, coconut milk, cinnamon, blueberries  
&#8211; cucumber, apple, parsley juice – decided to stick to juice recipes I found instead of trying to make my own  
&#8211; banana, almond butter, hemp seed in a spelt tortilla  
&#8211; a couple seitan wings :-/, pickles, quinoa burger with onions, egg and mushrooms. This sounds gross but it was actually really good! I didn&#8217;t even have them bring the bun.  
&#8211; coconut water. They had a case sale on at Sunflower market.

My fridge now looks like this:

#### Exercise

&#8211; 30 minute tempo run (plus a few miles to warmup/cooldown, workout was just over an hour total).  
&#8211; bench press: 3&#215;85, 4&#215;85, 3&#215;90, 2&#215;95, 1&#215;100 (!!!), 3&#215;90, 5&#215;75, 5&#215;80, 5&#215;80, 6&#215;80, 5&#215;80, 10&#215;65, 30&#215;45. Highest weight ever, and I do think it helped make the 80 seem &#8220;light&#8221;  
&#8211; other chest and tricep work  
&#8211; light abs

While I like stopping at the gym on my way home from Boulder, and my coach did tell me to double up strength-training with runs, I really think I need to work on my bench press on different days. I need to be fresh for these workouts, coming there after an hour of intense exercise doesn&#8217;t truly give myself the opportunity to see what I can do. The race is in exactly a month!

#### Recovery

Between my run and the gym, I stopped at AllSports. Compression boots, inversion table, rumble roller. Good stuff! 

Here are some of the various rollers they have in the &#8220;self massage&#8221; area:
