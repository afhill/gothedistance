So it&#8217;s back.. a week ago I didnt have alot of confidence to go out and race, but now I want to see how I&#8217;d do. Decisions, decisions&#8230;

Chicago is 10/22.  
The Home Stretch 20 Miler is 09/24. I really should do that one, as I&#8217;ve been slacking in my Team Run Wild Races. Unfortunately, it puts my 20 miler out at c-4 (Chicago minus 4 weeks) rather than my preferred 3.

C-3 weeks is the Wooster Half.  
C-5 is the State to State Half, OR the Indian Runs. I did two of those last year, the 10K and the 20K, for an overall day of 18.6 miles of trail running. It was alot of fun..

So I&#8217;m debating what I should do. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s smart to race on successive weekends, although we ARE talking about me.. Hmmm&#8230;.
