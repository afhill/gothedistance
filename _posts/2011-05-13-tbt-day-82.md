Today, derby counts for exercise! I attended the RMRG bootcamp, where in addition to skated we also had an interesting nutrition session. I chatted with quite a few girls who mostly followed the raw diet, someone doing the paleo diet and a bunch of vegetarians and vegans. Overall food and exercise today was spot-on!

#### Food

  * Flax plus cereal, kefir, hemp seed, chia seed, strawberries</l> 
      * naked juice green machine drink
      * Vega sport performance optimizer w creatine
      * Lara bar
      * Vegan arepa: black beans, avocado, plantain
      * Trail mix
      * Sugar snap peas
      * garlic oregano yam oven fries (a bit soggy)
      * Falafel, spinach, tomato, bean sprouts in a whole wheat pita
      * Peaches
      * Ginger peach tea</ul> 
    #### Exercise
    
      * RMRG bootcamp: on-skates we did pack dynamics, agility and blocking. More intensely, off-skates we did basically 1.5 days&#8217; worth of the Awesome Jammer workout: sprints across the parking lot, plyometrics and some light abs. After the blocking drills, I noticed my shoulders were crazy-red, and chalked it up to the hitting. Nope.. turns out I managed to get sunburnt during the AJW and lunch outside!
      * 2 hr joint Electrocuties/Rollin Bones practice &#8211; yes, after bootcamp I went to the Glitterdome and skated a team practice.
