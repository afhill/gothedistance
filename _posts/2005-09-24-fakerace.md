_10K &#8211; 15K Race_ 

Rather than actually racing, I&#8217;d made plans to run with Bridget, and told her I wanted to do a 7:30 pace. That would be &#8216;easy&#8217; for her ðŸ™‚

Woke up this morning to a thunderstorm. I HATE running in the rain, but I didn&#8217;t have Bridget&#8217;s number to call and cancel, so I headed out to meet her. It had pretty well stopped raining by the time I got to the park. She was there with her boyfriend, and we both said it was ok if the other didnt want to run &#8211; we set out anyway. The plan was 5; at the end of which Bridget asked if we wanted to do one lap around the lake: another 1.2. 

5 miles: 38:59 (7:47 overall pace)  
6.2 miles: 47:43 (7:41 overall pace)

I realized on the way home that dang, my 10K race PR is 47:51&#8230; so this was exactly race pace!

It start spitting a little on that last loop around the lake, but we were back in our cars by the time it really started to pour.

Hopefully it will be nicer for the 16 miles tomorrow!

Oh, I forgot one thing. I actually had a cramp in about the 2nd mile (I think my bagel was digesting) but I kept going. I think had I been by myself, I would have stopped or slowed, but I didn&#8217;t and it eventually passed. Important lesson there ðŸ™‚ Run through it.
