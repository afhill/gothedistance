3:15am wakeup call for a biz trip to California! But, Berkeley is very TBT-friendly üôÇ I&#8217;m a creature of habit, so some of this stuff has been in this blog before.

Food  
&#8211; PB and honey on Ezekiel bread  
&#8211; banana  
&#8211; [Bhakti Chai/Coffee blend](http://www.shop.bhaktichai.com/product.sc?productId=1&categoryId=1)..I&#8217;ve been drinking these recently, but given my getting back into the TBT, should probably give them up üôÅ  
&#8211; clif oatmeal raisin bar  
&#8211; fresh-squeezed OJ  
&#8211; egg white omelet &#8211; mushroom, spinach, avocado from [Au Coquelet](http://www.yelp.com/biz/au-coquelet-cafe-restaurant-berkeley)  
&#8211; rye bread  
&#8211; sesame chickpea sandwich on multi-grain bread from [New Amsterdam](http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-amsterdam-coffeeshop-berkeley)  
&#8211; tea  
&#8211; falafel pita and salad bar from [Chick O Peas](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chick-o-peas-berkeley).. and just now realized that pita itself may have been organic, but likely wasn&#8217;t TBT-approved. dangit!  
&#8211; there were homemade brownies at the client&#8217;s office, that everyone raved over. I let them enjoy em!

Exercise:  
Theoretically my long run this weekend was supposed to be 8 miles (at either 7:52 or 7:42, I couldn&#8217;t remember). Since I did 5 miles on Friday and I&#8217;m still not feeling 100%, AND it was raining out, I decided to let myself only do 3. I ended up with 3.5 at a 7:46 pace. I ran around UC Berkeley, which actually involved a pretty big hill for the first mile, and lots of dodging students with umbrellas. 

The TBT Facebook page hasn&#8217;t been showing updates, so I tried to figure out an alternative today. We&#8217;ll see if my messing around helped at all!
