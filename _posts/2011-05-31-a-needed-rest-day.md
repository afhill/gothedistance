Despite trying to eat well and getting a massage yesterday, my body decided it needed a rest today. I&#8217;m not sore or anything, just lacking that &#8220;oomph&#8221;. Interestingly enough, though, I loooove my endorphins so I just felt a bit on edge all day. It was a bit of a &#8216;damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t. I lacked the motivation to work out, but I was definitely lacking the postive energy I get from working out. 

I did pretty well though at not looking to &#8220;comfort stimulants&#8221; like coffee to bolster my spirits. I did try some hemp iscream frozen dessert for a treat (no white sugar).. it wasn&#8217;t really worth it. 

#### Food

  * part of a smoothie &#8211; didn&#8217;t taste great today
  * whole foods breakfast burrito
  * grapes, cherries, raspberries
  * mango ginger tofu with bean thread noodles
  * apple with peanut butter
  * bean thread noodles and peanut sauce
  * [Hemp IScream](http://hempiscream.webstarts.com/) &#8211; wow, if I&#8217;d seen this website before I bought the treat, I may not have&#8230;

#### Exercise

I went to the gym, but didn&#8217;t do much before I called it quits. My body is ready for a break!

  * pecs
  * wide lat pulldowns
  * 14 TRX rows
  * chest press
