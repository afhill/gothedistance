Tonight I stopped by the Glitterdome, the [Denver Roller Dolls](http://www.denverrollerdolls.org) practice facility. I haven&#8217;t skated since September, and officially left the league in November, and it was bittersweet to set foot in the space again. I was happy to see the familiar faces. There are people you stay in touch with and make an effort to see, but also many others that were part of your life in a peripheral way. Of course, people asked if I was coming back, if I missed skating. I could only smile and say that no, I didn&#8217;t miss it. 

I have a weird amnesia about sport, I realized it while I was still skating. I&#8217;d come off the track after a jam and someone would comment on something that happened, and I&#8217;d have no idea what they were talking about. I&#8217;d be present in the moment, but it was as though things were in some sort of short-term &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; state and I wouldn&#8217;t retain it. 

Sadly, this doesn&#8217;t help someone want to stay in a sport for the long term. Not when the joys or accomplishments are in the black box of your brain, and the aches and pains and bruises are the evidence of your activity.

Roller derby was hard on me, not simply physically. It was emotionally tough for me to be on a team, not solely focused on my own performance. Although there are a few flashbacks I have of skating and grinning and having fun, there&#8217;s a lot more time I recall feeling anxiety and apprehension over how I&#8217;d do. 

Reflecting on it, I don&#8217;t know if this athletic amnesia is related at all to why I feel compelled to count and track and record everything I do. I still have the old spreadsheets comparing [the mileage through my first few marathons](http://afhill.com/running/mileagecompared.html). (Click on &#8220;compared&#8221;!) So I have a record of how things went, even if I don&#8217;t recall every second. Heck, forgetting some of the pain of a hard workout or race is probably for the best! It may be what allows me to sign up for races or take on hard workouts, because I can &#8220;check out&#8221; and just let my body go and I don&#8217;t remember how much it hurt at the time.

I&#8217;m ok with being sore after a hard workout, it&#8217;s actual pain that concerns me. It&#8217;s the reason I keep making excuses not to go to crossfit. I&#8217;m ok with forgetting things in the moment, but I don&#8217;t want to pay for it in pain for days later. I&#8217;m afraid in crossfit my competitive spirit will take over and I&#8217;ll work too hard. I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s totally amnesia, but there is definitely the sense that I don&#8217;t really recognize my limits when I&#8217;m doing strength exercises. Oddly enough, I&#8217;ve still never done anything crazy while doing cardio &#8211; my [central governor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_governor) seems to be working well &#8211; but I&#8217;ve definitely left both kettlebell and crossfit workouts with severe pain that lasted for days because I wasn&#8217;t willing to stop. I definitely get into a different zone when I work out. 

**Do you have athletic amnesia, or do you remember all your workouts?**
