The first year I ran Columbus (04), the Race Director for the Boston Marathon spoke at the Expo to a crowd of Boston hopefuls. Someone asked what the final day to register was. The RD looked around before replying that there was an official &#8220;last day to register&#8221;, but he didn&#8217;t anticipate ever turning away anyone with a qualifying time.

So I was a bit surprised to see the following on bostonmarathon.com today:  
&#8220;We have reached our field size limit for the 2008 Boston Marathon. Registration is now CLOSED to further entries.&#8221;

I&#8217;m just VERY happy that my friends qualified and entered in time. Last year just wasn&#8217;t right! ðŸ™‚<br clear="all" />
