I have [a friend who&#8217;s training for her first marathon](http://fannyreinvention.wordpress.com)!! I&#8217;m excited for her! She&#8217;ll be following the Hal Higdon 18 week plan, the plan that I used when I first started with this distance. 

I injured myself in 2002 training for what was supposed to be my first marathon &#8211; ramped up my mileage too quickly. So when I decided to start running again, I tried to play it safe. I did a lot of cross-training and days off. It worked &#8211; I got to the finish line healthy and still in a pretty decent time. When people are first starting out, I think it&#8217;s great for them to just focus on staying healthy. 

I told her I track my mileage on spreadsheets just to be able to see how things progress, and shared a link to [my old excel spreadsheet from my first few marathons](afhill.com/running/mileagecompared.html). Yup, I tracked my mileage for each race, and compared them. 

It&#8217;s pretty ridiculous to look at the mileage I did then, and what I do now&#8230; 

Columbus Marathon 04: avg 24MPW (14 weeks) &#8211; ran 3:38:39  
Boston Marathon 05: avg 29MPW (18 weeks) &#8211; ran 3:57:43  
Sunburst Marathon 05: avg 29MPW (6 weeks after Boston) &#8211; ran 3:56:41  
Steamtown Marathon 05: avg 42MPW (12 weeks) &#8211; ran 3:30:05  
Columbus Marathon 05: avg 30MPW (1 week after Steamtown, so 26.2 of that was the race) &#8211; ran 3:57:12  
Detroit Marathon 05: avg 30MPW (1 week after Columbus, so 26.2 of that was the race) &#8211; ran 3:36:08

&#8230;  
then I stopped using a spreadsheet until 2012. 

It&#8217;s pretty interesting to look at see what I&#8217;m doing now! I&#8217;ve obviously evolved as an athlete overall, and my body can handle the higher mileage and more intense workouts. I don&#8217;t doubt that&#8217;s why I managed to chop **20 minutes** off my PR! Sadly, I don&#8217;t have a spreadsheet outlining my weekly mileage leading up to Houston &#8211; what a shame üôÅ thankfully I&#8217;m back on track with my tracking :-), so I will have more numbers to look at going forward! 

In the 12 weeks leading up to the Leadville marathon I averaged 40MPW (I actually averaged that over the entire year!), and in the following 6 weeks leading up to Pikes Peak, I averaged 48MPW. But neither of those were real target races with a build up phase &#8211; the longest run I did before Leadville was 13 miles (!!) and between Leadville and Pikes Peak I did a 16 and an 18).

BUT, I&#8217;ve averaged 46MPW since November 1, and over 50MPW for the past month. What??

I&#8217;m really excited to see how this mileage will pay off in my race in a few weeks, and going into the fall when I decide to tackle my favorite race distance again! In the meantime, I look forward to living vicariously through my friend &#8211; all her &#8216;firsts&#8217;!
