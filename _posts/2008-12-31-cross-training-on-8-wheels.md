I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve explicitly stated it on here yet, but I&#8217;ve decided to try out for the <a href="http://www.denverrollerdolls.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">Denver Roller Dolls</a> Roller Derby League. I saw the <a href="http://www.ohiorollergirls.com/" rel="nofollow">Ohio Roller Girls</a> play in Columbus, and have been to a few <a href="http://rockymountainrollergirls.com/index.php/" rel="nofollow">Rocky Mountain Roller Girls</a> bouts here in Denver. I actually tried out for the RMRG a few weeks ago, but unfortunately their practice schedule doesn&#8217;t work with my job.

<!--more-->When I tried out for RMRG, I felt ok going into the tryout. Obviously I&#8217;m athletic, and I actually used to go to the roller skating rink every Saturday through grades 4-6, and I played on my sorority&#8217;s ice hockey team in college. (Yes &#8211; a sign of a true Canadian, our sorority had a hockey team!) I was comfortable through the free skate, and the endurance and speed part was a breeze. However, the actual skills part of the tryout was a bit of a stretch: another girl trying out actually helped me with cross-overs, since I had no idea what I was doing! By the end of the tryout I was doing ok, but it was apparent to me that practice would help.

So in preparation of trying out for the other league, yesterday I headed to a local rink for some practice. It was a lot of fun! The rink in Littleton was a little less scary than the one <a href="http://itsamonkey.blogspot.com/2008/05/there-are-lot-of-rules-in-roller.html" rel="nofollow">Melissa</a> and I had visited back in Columbus. Sure, there was still the hip-hop music with certain words beeped out, but it was much more family-focused and fun. 

Being on my own let me experiment a little bit, trying skating fast and trying to really get the hang of doing cross-overs. Before too long my natural athleticism kicked in and I found myself zooming along, completely comfortable. After awhile, however, I found my right foot was hurting, and I knew I was getting a blister on the ball of my foot. Still, I was having so much fun, I ignored it as I zoomed around the track, avoiding kids and especially their parents! I smiled as I skated; remembering my lack of fear of falling from my hockey days. 

Eventually they introduced another activity: everyone was supposed to skate backwards. I was still imagining myself invincible, so I eagerly got on the ice and scooted around. I was a bit uneasy, but managed to get going all right. Unfortunately, many of the other skaters weren&#8217;t doing so well, and as I tried to stop to avoid some Moms inching along the rink, I twisted and fell smack on my right knee.

It hurt! And compounding the pain was the inner coach voice saying &#8220;DON&#8217;T TRY ANY NEW PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES DURING TAPER&#8221;. Whoops.. 

I got up and headed off the rink. It was probably for the best anyway, given the blister on my foot. I returned my skates and literally limped out of the rink. How stupid of me! Sure, the rest of the time was great exercice, but I really don&#8217;t need to be putting the big marathon in jeopardy! 

I iced my knee last night and it feels better today, although the blister on my foot is still sore. I know I am definitely still interested in trying out, but I&#8217;ll certainly need to invest in some knee pads (maybe even before tryouts?)
