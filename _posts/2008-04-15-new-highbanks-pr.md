A few months ago, I found my paper running journal from 2004. I was shocked to read the entry on 04/09/04 where I ran Highbanks with the gang in 47:03. Generally these days we run it in a pretty comfortable 50 or 51 minutes. I&#8217;ve been bothered with the idea that I&#8217;m actually slowing down.

This week, my training schedule calls for a 7 mile &#8220;dress rehearsal&#8221; run, with either 2 or 5 miles at target race pace (I never remember). I got out of work early today, and the gorgeous weather and my taper legs were enough incentive to go for it! 

I figured that an 8:30 pace would put me in at less than 47 minutes, so that was my goal. 

Now I know why we don&#8217;t run this hard on the weekends: I was breathing heavily for most of the run, and definitely would not have been able to engage in conversation! 

Mile 1: 8:13. avgHR 170, maxHR 182  
Mile 2: 8:39 avgHR 179 maxHR 185  
Mile 3: 8:04 avgHR 178 maxHR 186  
Part way through mile 3, I was coming up on another runner. I don&#8217;t really like passing, particularly when I&#8217;m breathing heavily. So at mile 3.4, I stopped for a minute or two to let the other runner get away. My heart rate dropped to 125 before I started again.

Mile 4: 7:46 avgHR 178 maxHR 183  
Mile 5: 9:04 avgHR 182 maxHR 187 darn hill ðŸ˜‰  
.6 7:48 pace avgHR 184 maxHR 187

My final time was 45:47, which I&#8217;m super excited about. It wasn&#8217;t a particularly FUN run, but I had a great sense of accomplishment afterwards. While I was running, I was thinking that the marathon &#8216;spoils you&#8217;. If you can find that comfortable pace, you just have to maintain it. A shorter distance like this means putting effort into every step!

Have I mentioned I&#8217;m excited for Boston? Only a few more days!!!
