Today was a good Saturday, though I sooo want to be out running. Without intense cardio (and sometimes with it), I just feel I can&#8217;t get a good enough workout in. I did wii active, a silly &#8220;buns of steel video&#8221;, hit the machines at the gym for an hour AND rode my bike. And of course did my pt exercises. I actually forgot about my injury briefly and ran up my stairs.. And right away felt a weird numbness in my bursa. It didn&#8217;t hurt, which was good, but things aren&#8217;t quite right yet. Of course, who&#8217;s to say that&#8217;s not a direct response to three days of electrical stimulation??
