#### Food

  * tea
  * Ezekiel cereal with kefir and strawberries. I used the last of my hemp seeds in the hummus yesterday so I had a spoonful of hemp seed oil
  * orange juice
  * shake n go smoothie
  * quinoa, lowfat milk, cinnamon, strawberries
  * chai with 2% milk!! I ordered a nf latte but they REALLY messed my order up and I was running late and didn&#8217;t have time for them to redo it
  * hummus, pita, carrots
  * veggie sandwich (Inc. Avocado) on rye. I have in mind rye isn&#8217;t white flour. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s really the case.
  * dr. Kracker flatbread with almond butter and banana
  * bolthouse green goodness smoothie &#8211; I was irritable after practice. A few years ago if I felt that way after running, I&#8217;d drink sugary soda. I&#8217;m looking for a better alternative
  * cantaloupe
  * edamame, miso soup, inari, sushi. My lips were burning from the salt of the edamame and the soup as I gulped down water. :-/

I had a good visit with my parents, and tomorrow they&#8217;ll continue their trek back to the homeland (Canada). Happily, Mom has my copy of &#8220;the Eat Clean Diet Recharged&#8221; in tow!

#### Exercise

Officially:

  * Rest day

Unofficially:

  * abs
  * pushups
  * 2 hrs derby practice: one hour of scrimmage where I jammed a lot, one hour of team practice. It felt great to be back at full force!
