Amazing meal Drink  
Spelt muffin with Greek yogurt  
Oatmeal with almond butter and hemp seed  
Greek yogurt with blueberries and hemp seed  
Chicken pho (I&#8217;m not a vegetarian but felt like I was &#8220;cheating&#8221; with this)  
Hummus, falafel, veggie salad, tabbouleh, egg, whole wheat pita

Did wii active this morning and PT exercises tonight. I feel slobby and realllly miss hard cardio. (although my arms and shoulders feel like I have some improvement there). I&#8217;m hoping the PT clears me to run this weekend. I&#8217;ve biked the past few weekends but we got a big dump of snow this week and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;ll be an option. 

Bad food day! I was acutely aware of how bad the falafel probably was for me.

Weight: 110.6 (I bet this will change tomorrow!)
