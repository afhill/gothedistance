Today I ran a mile! I was pretty self-aware and everything felt good! Granted, at the marathon it didn&#8217;t hurt til mile 7&#8230; I also rode on the trainer for a bit.  
I&#8217;m hoping to get back to the gym next week; my arms and shoulders felt great after last time and I want to keep it up.

It was a cold day in ole Denver, and I had two Starbucks chais. By the evening my stomach was sore and extremely bloated by bedtime. I wonder if it was milk-related? I&#8217;ve never been much of a milk-drinker&#8230; The lactose in greek yogurt is lower than in milk, which may be why I stomach it better?  
Or, it not be related to that at all. I just like to speculate..
