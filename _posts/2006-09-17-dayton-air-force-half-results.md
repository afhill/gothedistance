Just did a search for my results at the Dayton Air Force Half. It looked as follows:

For those of you not keeping track, I ran 1:42:05 at the Last Chance for Boston Half in 2005. So I was a little surprised to see that number again. Surely I hadn&#8217;t told them what my previous PR was, had I? Nope, in fact that was my gun time, chip time was the 1:41:56. So yes, I PRed, and I&#8217;m quite glad for chip timing, or I wouldn&#8217;t have PRed at all!

I also have to say a big **CONGRATS** to Hungry Hungry Helen for her marathon the other weekend. She was the one who was misrouted and ran 28.xx miles? Well they extrapolated and came up with a marathon time for her, I think by using her 20 mile and final time. And the verdict? A fantastic 3:24:18, which made her the first place woman!! Fantastic just in general, but sweetened even more by the fact there was prize money!! She did kickass, I&#8217;ll be interested to see how she does in Chicago when she only runs 26.2!!! (her PR was set in Boston this Sprint, 3:34)&#8230; she&#8217;s doing incredible!
