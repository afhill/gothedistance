.2: 7:12pace ++ 8:13

Finish time: 3:36:50/ avg pace 8:13

Initially, my goal had been 3:23, which I knew was a 7:45 pace. As it grew nearer to the race, I told myself my goal was 3:25, but I never actually worked out what that pace was. As I ran, I aimed for 7:45, knowing that was more aggressive than an average pace I would reasonably sustain. Still, I tried to stay close to 7:45, without being disappointed if I was slightly off.  
I just did the math now, and realize that a 3:25 is a 7:49 pace, which I held onto until mile 19. I wonder if I had toned it down just slightly earlier when I was at a 7:47 pace, if I could have sustained it a bit longer&#8230;

I know a 3:36:50 is not too shabby at all! The conditions weren&#8217;t great, and the race director even sent out the following in an email today:  
_Heat &#8211; Sorry about the heat. Yesterday was by far the hottest Steamtown on record. To give you an idea of the impact heat can have, our median finish time yesterday was a full 10 minutes slower than the average for our first 11 years. We also treated more runners in our medical area than ever before. We hope that all of you enjoy a complete recovery._  
Hm&#8230;. 3:25 goal, 3:36 time. Sounds like I was average&#8230; 

Today I am definitely sore &#8212; stairs are not my friend! I&#8217;m pretty sure I wasn&#8217;t this sore after the race two years ago, this feels like a &#8220;first Boston&#8221; experience! I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it has anything to not having run a marathon for 11 months, although Helen is also struggling more than usual, and she has run several other races this year.

So now of course the big question is, what to do in Columbus? My plan had been that Steamtown was my target race, and Columbus to be easy, but I definitely think I have a better performance in me than I exhibited yesterday. Naturally it all depends on recovery, but I would love to get out there and have a strong PR race this year&#8230;
