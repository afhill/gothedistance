Recently I was looking at old race photos, and noticed my arm definition. When I moved to Ohio, I&#8217;d hit up the gym a few times a week for overall strength training and conditioning. 

This morning at the rec center I decided to hit up the machines to do some different things. I did a light circuit, nothing too crazy, just to ease myself back into it. I was actually pretty surprised at how weak some areas were, although it shouldn&#8217;t be a shock.

My membership at the rec center is on a punch-card basis, so it makes sense to go for longer workouts. I&#8217;m definitely going to try to carve out more time to be able to work on more.
