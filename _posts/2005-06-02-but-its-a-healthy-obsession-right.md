My Mom is doing great in her running aspirations. She read some Galloway article (\*shudder\*, I tried to talk her out of it) on training for a 10K that maxed out at 35 min of running. Well she can do that now (no walking breaks) and it&#8217;s still 12 weeks til the race. I think she&#8217;ll do just fine&#8230; ðŸ™‚ I&#8217;m expecting her to finish strong and wonder what the next challenge is, so naturally, what do I put in front of her?

No, she&#8217;s probbly not going to be ready for a marathon (although I think she could do it, I know my mom and she would want to do WELL). But she could do the half.. and, well, maybe I&#8217;d do the full, or maybe I&#8217;d do the half with her and THEN the full. Yes, that&#8217;s how crazy I&#8217;m getting about this stuff. But they&#8217;re marketing a package where people do both, and I was thinking it would be nice to do the half WITH my mom, and hopefully that would be at an easy enough pace I could gut out a marathon the next day. What&#8217;s happening to me????
