Dinner was at a local bar/restaurant that focused on things like nachos and sweet potato fries, and I managed to make one of the healthiest decisions I could. Then tonight I tried to prep for the week ahead: made a few days worth of brown rice, hard-boiled eggs, and veggies and some tilapia. Now I won&#8217;t have to think about it for a few days and can just throw some things together. 

Tomorrow the wii roller derby game is out, so I turned on my wii for a few minutes. I have wii active and did a VERY short workout. I forgot it has things like tricep kickbacks with a band, squats, lunges, etc. Why the heck am I not using it?? I&#8217;ll start, I swear ðŸ™‚  
Also, skated today. I focused on form and technique. It felt ok, though I definitely want to be sure I&#8217;m not hindering my recovery.
