Funny, just this evening I was talking to a friend about training, saying that I&#8217;d done the Pfitz 55/12 for the past few falls and half-heartedly for the past few springs. I said I wasn&#8217;t sure if I wanted to look at a different plan or stick with it, but I needed to decide, as Monday signals 12 weeks til Boston!

Tonight I was poking around online and I went to the McMillan site to take a look at the paces calculator, and an article caught my eye:[Time to Rethink Your Marathon Training Program?](http://runningtimes.com/rt/articles/?id=9254&page=1) Hmmm, I was just wondering the same thing ðŸ™‚

The plan is actually pretty interesting &#8211; I&#8217;ve heard of it before. The idea is to move &#8220;speed&#8221; up earlier in the training cycle. It&#8217;s interesting because I know that&#8217;s an area I can definitely stand to improve the most in.

One of the personas mentioned for &#8220;who should try the new method&#8221; is &#8220;Runners who find that during marathon training, they get &#8220;stuck&#8221; at a pace and simply canâ€™t go any faster.&#8221; I think I fit that group: my PR for the 5K through the marathon distance is all within ~45seconds per mile. I think in part this is because I dont put enough emphasis on speed. Moving it earlier in the training period would allow me to focus on it when I was &#8216;fresher&#8217;, and also limit any negatives from strain or stress. 

Who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll give it a try, something to think about&#8230;.
