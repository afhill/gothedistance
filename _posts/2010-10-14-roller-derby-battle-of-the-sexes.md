This Saturday is the season championships for my roller derby league, the Denver Roller Dolls. My team placed 3rd (of 3 üôÅ ) in the league, so we weren&#8217;t eligible for the championships. We looked around for an opponent for the consolation bout, and ended up doing something pretty exciting and unique: we booked a men&#8217;s league to play against!

This sort of thing happens now and then at large events like RollerCon, but it&#8217;s not really standard. There were a few logistics to take care of (our **Womens** Flat Track Derby Association insurance wouldn&#8217;t cover the event), but it looks like it&#8217;ll all work out!

We know the men of the Rollin Bones league &#8211; they practice at the Pick-Up Derby program run by one of our skaters, they come to our bouts to support us and also help volunteer with track setup, etc. Last night in anticipation of Saturday&#8217;s big game, we scrimmaged against them. Aware of the physical differences, they play a positional game where they don&#8217;t lay out big hits on us, but we were free to play as aggressively as we wanted. 

We started off, and we were immediately aware of the difference in speed: the game was FAST! However, we had agility on our side and were able to maneuver around our opponents. 

At half-time, any of the pre-game jitters from either side were dissipated. We actually told the guys to feel free not to go so easy on us üôÇ 

It was a super fun time for everyone: the speed of the game was different for us and good experience, and I enjoyed working on my lateral movement to get around the guys. This was the first time for some of our skaters to play against someone not in our league, and there were sentiments that they felt more comfortable laying a hit out on the men because they knew they wouldn&#8217;t hurt them (come on, this is derby, you&#8217;re not supposed to worry about that!!) 

All in all, I&#8217;m really excited about Saturday and thankful we&#8217;ll have this opportunity. Different opponents and different styles of play will only help all of us!

GIRL POWER!
