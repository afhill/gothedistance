Everytime I run at Sloan&#8217;s Lake, I think about sharing it with people. Most notably, I think about running through New York City with Elyssa, and how different MY neighborhood run is! So here it is &#8211; 

Sloan&#8217;s Lake is roughly 2 miles from my house (no need to make things too easy on you potential stalkers!), and it&#8217;s about 2.5 miles around. Makes for a nice morning run. 

On one side you can see downtown Denver in the distance, and on the other the mountains beckon. It&#8217;s gorgeous. There are always people out walking or running, enjoying the peaceful space.
