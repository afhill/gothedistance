Yesterday I really tried to cut back on my carbs and up my protein to get ready for the weekend. Today I was a bit more lax, although I still avoided grains. I&#8217;d called into the Ben Greenfield Fitness podcast and asked about [nutrition before the pump and run](http://www.bengreenfieldfitness.com/2012/02/episode-184-do-booze-and-exercise-mix/), and he responded on the show and I heard it last night. (btw, my voice recording sounds REALLY weird &#8211; do I sound like that on the phone?) His stance wasn&#8217;t to restrict or try to be dehydrated going into the weigh-in, as it would compromise strength. He also commented on how important it was to focus on the bench press. Ugh&#8230; I am so not sure if I&#8217;m ready for this. I&#8217;m not sure how it happened &#8211; I totally had lots of confidence but I just don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m where I need to be&#8230;  
He also gave some tips for technique. I may have to squeeze in one more gym session to give some of them a try!

#### Food

&#8211; Cottage cheese  
&#8211; Ezekiel cereal with kefir, hemp seed, blueberries  
&#8211; Raisins  
&#8211; Good belly drink  
&#8211; Adzuki bean burger patties  
&#8211; Kale chips  
&#8211; Apple  
&#8211; Whole foods Salad bar  
&#8211; Vega sports protein  
&#8211; Monster aminos  
&#8211; glass of Apple cider vinegar, molasses, water

#### Exercise

  * 3.8 mile run &#8211; felt a weird twinge in my right calf
  * crazy arms at the gym! I normally hate doing biceps but decided to just go for it today. Also did a ton of different types of pushups: 
      * clap pushups 3&#215;10
      * one-armed pushups on the bench 3
      * regular pushups 30
      * bench pushups 2&#215;10
      * pushups where you have one hand on a medicine ball and roll it to the other hand &#8211; 10
      * atomic pushups with a swiss ball (feet on ball for pushup, then pull it into your chest) &#8211; 2&#215;15
      * pushups holding a 10lb weight in each hand, then twist into a T (holding weight above you) &#8211; 3
  * bench press &#8211; 2x(30x35lbs)
  * bicep curls 
      * 35x10lbs
      * 25&#215;7.5lbs
      * 6x15lbs
      * 4x20lbs
      * 20x10lbs
      * concentration curls: 10x12lbs
  * LOTS of abs

I&#8217;d wanted to try the [dramatic transformation principle](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/01/dramatic-transformation-principle/) thing with the bicep curls (do a ladder from 50 reps down to 10 with heavier weights, then build back up), but even at 10 lbs my arms were done at 35 reps. However, I was able to recover and do more reps later. I really tried to be explosive in the curls as well as the pushups, to get the most out of the exercise. It&#8217;s really amazing to me how much muscular endurance I have &#8211; just wish I could pile on a bit more strength! One thing I did notice &#8211; the other day I was having trouble at the very bottom of the bicep curl, when your arm is straight. I did some really light weight then, and I definitely felt like it helped today!

Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on- can&#8217;t wait til short sleeved shirt season!
