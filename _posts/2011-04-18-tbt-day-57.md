        #### Exercise
        
        So after my [brief freak-out about losing arm definition](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/04/sliding-backwards/) (which turns out not to be the case), I knew I wanted to hit my arms hard. 
        
        To warm-up, I did a brief circuit based off some of the bootcamp stuff I used to do:
        
          * 2x(1min each of) 
              * pushups
              * weighted lunges
              * burpees
              * mountain climbers
              * mallogator pushups
            
            with 1min rest between the sets</li> 
            
              * Smith Machine Bench Press: 4 sets of 6-8 repetitions (45lbs+15lb bar)
              * Smith Machine Bent Over Row: 4 sets of 6-8 repetitions (40lbs+15lb bar)
              * Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions (20lbs)
              * Bicep Curl: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions (1-20lbs, 2-15lbs)
              * Rope Tricep Pull-downs: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions (30lbs)
              * (my addition) Rotation 3 sets of 10-12 (20lbs)</ul> 
            
            I am in my second week taking Creatine (even though I forgot yesterday üôÅ ) so I was down to about 10g. I took 5g before and 5g after working out. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s helping or what, but I was able to add onto my weight from last week almost completely across the board. Still hate bicep curls; my arms were killing by the end. 
            
            I&#8217;d like to do back and chest tomorrow, but with running and derby back on the schedule, my time is limited. üôÅ
