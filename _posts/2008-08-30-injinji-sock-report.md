After much [encouragement](http://twitter.com/rrg98/statuses/883642281) from interested parties, I finally gave my injinji socks a try today!

I was meeting the gang out for a trail run at highbanks. I also considered trying out my new trail shoes, but I held off. I felt that changing two variables would be an unfair test of the products ðŸ™‚

[<img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/injinji-300x300.jpg" alt="" title="injinji socks" width="300" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-560" />](http://www.rei.com/product/711809)I will admit it took a bit longer to put on the socks &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t used to placing each toe in its own little area. Immediately, however, I felt that each toe was cushioned moreso than normal. 

I met up with the gang, and we had a good run. After one loop we stopped for a water break, and I pulled off my shoe to get rid of a rock. I&#8217;d already forgotten about the socks when someone asked about them. There was plenty of interest in the socks, and I realized that they really did feel good! I also had to demonstrate my ability to pick up a leaf with my toes, which seemed to earn the socks some respect&#8230;

The socks are a bit thinner than my smartwools, and my shoes pulled on easily (as opposed to the [balegas from a few weeks ago](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/08/balega-socks/)). After the second loop we were standing around and there was a bit of a breeze, and I realized my feet felt nice and cool. I was also able to flex my toes and stretch them much more easily than if they were all crammed together.

The run today was just under 2 hours, and I believe the benefits of the socks would be even more evident with long runs. I was very favorably impressed!
