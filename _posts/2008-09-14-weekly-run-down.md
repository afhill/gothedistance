After last week&#8217;s 40 miles, I was feeling strong and motivated. On Monday I set out for a nice run in the middle of the afternoon. I told myself to run for an hour, &#8220;and/or 7 miles&#8221;. It was warm out, but not too muggy. I felt great on the run, and ended up doing 7.5 miles in 1:02. 

M1:8:37,  
M2:8:18,  
M3:8:18,  
M4:8:00,  
M5:8:30, (where I tried to figure out how much further to run)  
M6:8:36, (where I managed to get lost in taking a short-cut)  
M7:7:16  
.5: 4:30. (cooldown)

Tuesday I did an easy mile.  
Wednesday I met Meredith for [a great interval workout](http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/09/forget-tuesdays-with-morrie/).  
Thursday I had another easy run  
Friday I considered &#8220;running an errand&#8221; (running to Lowe&#8217;s &#8211; just over 5 miles each way). It was already after 7pm when I started, and it got dark quickly. Two miles in, I decided that this wasn&#8217;t really a prudent idea, so I turned around and came home.  
Saturday my friend [Mike K](http://krotscheck.net) and I went out to Highbanks. I was glad he came with me, as the rest of the group was AWOL (the majority of them where running the [Reach the Beach](http://rtbrelay.com) relay, but there were a few other no-shows!). We managed to avoid the rain and did a decent loop in 50:30. I had initially invited Mike to run two loops with me, but as we ran he mentioned the marathon &#8220;next week&#8221;. I&#8217;d forgotten that his first ever marathon was to be run on 09/20. I asked him how far his training schedule had him scheduled to run, his response was &#8220;three miles&#8221;. So I told him that we would NOT be starting a second loop!

Today I planned to head out for a fantastic eleven. I was so energized by the interval workout with Meredith that I was going to do some speedwork again. I set my Garmin for a workout: 2 mile warmup, 7x (.5 mile between 6:30-7:30, .5 mile recovery), 2 mile cooldown. I headed out to Antrim, where I was shocked at the number of cars! I started off, taking it easy for my warmup. Run, run, run until all of a sudden only 1.57miles in, I felt a sharp shooting pain in the center of my knee. Wha?  
I stopped, and bent my knee. Nothing. Walked a few steps. Nothing. Tried to jog &#8211; pain. 

_For anyone who doesn&#8217;t know, I was hit by a car in 1994, and broke my femur and knee. I had a rod inserted in my leg to hold things together as they healed. A year later, the rod was removed. I didn&#8217;t take up running until 2001 and obviously the injury doesn&#8217;t prevent me from running, but my left knee is definitely my weak spot._ 

I am not willing to get further injured, so I turned around and made the long trek back to the car. Mentally, I tried to determine if there was anything I&#8217;d done to trigger this. Yesterday I was wearing my new trail running shoes, I don&#8217;t know if that could have played a part. I fell asleep on the couch last night, perhaps my knee was at a weird angle?  
So I made it home, and in typical Andrea-injury fashion, my knee now hurts more than it did before I ran. I&#8217;ll take it easy for the rest of the day ad hope that things work their way out. I&#8217;m disappointed I didn&#8217;t get to do my run, as I was really looking forward to it! But better to be sore today and take the time I need than let it get worse. I still hit over 30 miles this week, so that&#8217;s some consolation..
