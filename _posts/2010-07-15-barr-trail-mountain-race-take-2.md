This Sunday is the Barr Trail Mountain Race. I haven&#8217;t been training as hard this year, but I am eager to find out how experience will come into play. 

Last year&#8217;s results:  
Female place: 36  
Age group place: 6/17  
Splits:  
1 0:29:59  
2 0:50:25  
3 1:13:21  
4 1:38:07  
5 0:51:56  
End: 2:30:03

Last year my goal was to finish in less than three hours. So, obviously I did that well. Arbitrarily this year I&#8217;d like to finish in less than 2:30.  
It looks like I hit Barr Camp at 1:13, and so it took me a bit longer to come back down. Another goal may be to get to the top in 1:10 or less.Not necessarily because I feel stronger than last year, but just because it seems an easy milestone. We&#8217;ll see!
