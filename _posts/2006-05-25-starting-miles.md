As I was doing my treadmill workout yesterday, I was thinking of my last few races. Right now, I run my 5K workouts at roughly a 7:05 pace, because that is my 5K PR. However, I hit the first mile of my last three races at 7:05, 7:13 and 7:18, all the while never planning to go out that fast. And it&#8217;s actually not seeming to hard! I think I may have to try to push myself a bit to past that comfort level to see what I can get used to (case in point: Doug and I were chatting when we hit that 7:05 in the 5 miler &#8211; if it&#8217;s hard, I shouldn&#8217;t be able to be talking!)
