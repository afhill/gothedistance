About a month ago, I [tweeted](http://twitter.com/afhill262/statuses/814363018) that 40mpw seemed like a good average. Naturally, that statement was the kiss of death, and my weekly mileage has plummeted since then. 

I could chalk it up to the ridiculous heat we&#8217;ve been having lately, or the fact that I&#8217;ve started having a social life again (which isn&#8217;t conducive to long runs on Saturday mornings), or I could just admit I&#8217;ve been slacking. I&#8217;ve always said I do better with a plan, and I&#8217;ve proved it yet again.

I did make it over 30mpw this week, which is good. I haven&#8217;t gotten over 40mpw since the Flying Pig, and the other day a friend expressed some mild concern that I have a 32 mile race coming up in less than a month.

I&#8217;ll admit, I just haven&#8217;t been totally motivated as of late, but I assume that will come around. This weekend is the [Run for Pride 5K](http://www.premierraces.com/Races/Pride.html), which I participate in every year, so we&#8217;ll see how that goes. I had intended to try to get some speed work in prior to this race and the One Mile Dash in July, but that hasn&#8217;t quite panned out yet. I do know that after I hit the finish line on Saturday, my motivation will return. I just wish I&#8217;d be motivated BEFORE a race&#8230;
