My Mom and I were talking about heart rate the other day (she has been trying out a friend&#8217;s HRM) so I did a search back through my archive to find what I&#8217;d posted here. And actually, the garmin allows you to store &#8216;zones&#8217; for training, and so I want to define those to maximize my training. Obviously things could change based on tonight&#8217;s race (if I can push past 197bpm), but probably not by too much.

Garmin lists 5 Heart Rate Zones. I&#8217;ve defined:

1: < 153 (70% - for use on easy days) .. 4: > 175 (85%)  
5: > 182 (90%)

There are also 10 Pace Zones. These ones you can assign labels to.

For the ones with races assigned as labels, I am trying to prevent myself from going out too fast. The idea is that if it&#8217;s beeping, I should slow down.. at least for the fist 3/4s of the race ðŸ˜‰

I am trying to decide how best to set up the LT training paces, etc. I don&#8217;t want to psychmyself out if I am having trouble meeting a pace. Yet, I suppose that&#8217;s the point of training, isn&#8217;t it? I will prob give myself a 15 sec window&#8230;

1. &#8220;LTtraining&#8221; 7:10 &#8211; 7:40 (goal is 7:24)  
2. &#8220;MPtraining&#8221; 7:30 &#8211; 8 (goal is 7:47&#8230; not really ðŸ˜‰  
3. &#8220;5ktraining&#8221; 6:45 &#8211; 7:15 (goal is 7:00)  
..  
9. &#8220;5K&#8221; <6:30 10."Mile" <6:00
