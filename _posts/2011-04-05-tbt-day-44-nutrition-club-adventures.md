My coworker and I checked out the website and [were a bit skeptical](http://www.healthyblendznutrition.com), but decided to check it out. It seemed the premise of this &#8216;nutrition club&#8217; was that for $6, you&#8217;d get a shake, tea, etc. They also seemed to have weight loss programs and offer coaching. 

Right before we headed over, I saw a mention on their website of herbalife so I figured that&#8217;s what they were pushing. I wasn&#8217;t sure how TBT-friendly it&#8217;d be, but decided to give it a try anyway. It was a bit of a weird environment, there were couches with free wifi and a little bar where they served the drinks. The woman offered us our choice of drinks as well as the metabolism test. The test was just standing on a tanita scale and having her give us a copy of the results. As (somewhat) expected, everything was super processed and not clean-tasting. So, I&#8217;m pretty sure I cheated big üôÅ 

The results were interesting: I haven&#8217;t weighed myself in about a month, and it set me at 115lbs (granted, this was mid-day, right after lunch), 14% body fat. My muscle mass was 94.4, which she said means I should be getting 94g of protein a day (I love how many different guidelines there are). My metabolic age was 12!! But my bone mass was at 5, where it should be 5.3, so she said I&#8217;m low on vitamins and minerals. I&#8217;m not entirely convinced on that one.. 

While the smoothie itself was probably way bad for me (ok, no &#8216;probably&#8217;. I feel a bit buoyed by the [artificial flavors or whatever else](http://www.healthylifenow.com/3117_us_label.pdf)), I&#8217;m not adverse to stopping by to use their scale every so often! She said if we refer 3 people to try the free smoothies, we get another free, or we can stop by anytime for the analysis. 

That&#8217;s what was really so weird about this place: there was really no sales pitch. I&#8217;m not entirely clear how they plan to make money? Maybe my coworker and I (both fit and healthy) simply aren&#8217;t their target.. 

Um&#8230; I should admit something. I weighed myself yesterday afternoon at the gym as well, and it said 114. I was surprised and to some extent disappointed. I shouldn&#8217;t be! I told myself weight gain was a goal! But there was still something jarring to see the scale go up. I need to change my mindset about that, because that&#8217;s not healthy. I should be looking good b/c I&#8217;m muscular and fit, not because I&#8217;m scrawny!
