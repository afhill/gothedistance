Yesterday someone asked how running was going, and I responded that I wasn&#8217;t running much anymore. Granted, I need to recognize that I ran a marathon two weeks ago, so with tapering and recovering, I wouldn&#8217;t expect a ton of mileage, right??

Miles: 53 (yes, that&#8217;s including 26.2 of it at once)  
Roller derby: 8x (2 hrs per practice)

I also completed the 100 pushup challenge, doing pushups 3x/week.

I ran one race, the Last Chance for Boston marathon, where I won first in my age group.
