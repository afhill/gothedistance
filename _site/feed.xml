Well, at the end of July, she did it! She ran 4:49:54 at Jack and Jill – squeaking in a few seconds underneath the qualification window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/2019-chilliwack-mom.png&quot; alt=&quot;Womans at the end of a marathon finish line, holding a 'BQ Baby' sign&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when she qualified, I realized I didn’t have an eligible qualifying time that would allow me to register in September! I did some research and found the Revel Chilliwack race in mid-August. It was a mere three weeks away, which meant I’d be relying more on the aggressive downhill course than any serious training plan if I were to achieve my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My BQ time is 3:40; the same time I had to run when I first qualified back in 2004. Of course, I was 15 years younger then 🙂 In the few weeks leading up to the race I tried to throw in some marathon-pace miles into my runs, which felt fine, but I was never totally confident I’d be able to pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been very fortunate through my running career where I have run pretty well while feeling more or less at ease. I struggle when I have a hard goal ahead of me; it’s definitely fair to say that I’m stronger physically than mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race profile reminded me a bit of the Colorado Marathon in Ft Collins: an aggressive downhill at the start, flattening out at the end. The race preview description talks about banking a bit of time early on, and being prepared for your legs feeling flat and slow near the end. You won’t find a race report from the Colorado Half Marathon on my blog, because I hated it so much I took off my bib and walked in, without registering a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/rcw-profile.png&quot; alt=&quot;Revel Chilliwack Marathon Elevation Profile - showing a steep downhill race&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ran Duluth just a few months ago, I loved it because I put zero pressure on myself. I ran comfortable, letting my body dictate the pace. I figured this would be a different beast – and unfortunately, it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race was pretty small. We were bussed up to the start and there were a handful of runners hanging out by the 3:40 banner before 6am. Then people started moving – apparently the race had started?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the race I’d noticed a couple running together: they had bright flourescent on, so they were easy to spot. I started with them, and almost immediately the guys’ watch buzzed. “That’s going to become pretty annoying pretty quickly.” Said the woman running with him. I asked how much of a window they’d allowed on their pace. When he said 10 seconds, I laughed and said “I’m definitely not going to run near you, then!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept running, and perhaps a quarter mile or so later, a tall guy in a blue shirt ran up “you’re the 3:40 group? I’m your pacer. I didn’t know the race had started. Oh, and I forgot my flag”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were starting well…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is definitely aggressive from the start, and we hit the first mile at a sub-8 pace. Too fast! I asked the pacer his strategy. He said to bank a few seconds per mile early on. But 20+seconds per mile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second mile I even stopped to tie my shoe, and caught up with my pacer. We pegged another sub-8. Thankfully at mile 3 we got down to 8:10. But still much faster than our target pace. I mentioned the race was small: it was really only me, the pacer and one other guy.
We didn’t make much small talk: the pacer asked the other guy if he did a lot of races, the guy said ‘races are expensive’ and the pacer said “yeah they are, that’s why I pace”.
Not too much later, the other guy, who had a 3:50 goal, stopped at a bathroom, and then it was just me and the pacer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lap 4: 8:10
Lap 5: 8:03&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/revelphoto-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Woman running with a big smile on her face&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I was breathing harder than I should be, and told my pacer as much. His response was something like “if you weren’t here, I wouldn’t be running this pace”. I wasn’t sure what he meant. I told him that I’d run sub 3:40 before, but it had been awhile, and I was concerned about banking TOO much time early on. I thought that confiding in him as a pacer would somehow unburden me from my fears, and he’d be able to help guide me a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lap 6: 7:58
Lap 7: 8:07
Lap 8: 7:58&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will admit, I was really pleasantly surprised when we hit 8 miles. It had seemed to fly by (perhaps because we were running a lot faster than a 3:40 pace….)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacer was weird. He talked about himself a lot, and didn’t give me a lot of confidence. “If you weren’t here, I’d be off running that trail” “I haven’t run this pace for this long in awhile” and “I just want to finish this feeling good for my own races”. What the heck….Sorry to inconvenience you, guy….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly before the halfway mark, there was a screaming downhill, a 13% grade. I let loose and let my legs take me down. I was so thrilled that my knees and hips were playing nice. My pacer told me to let go, and he’d catch up. I felt strong physically, although my stomach felt a tiny bit queasy and I still felt like my breathing was a bit laboured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit the halfway mark at 1:46. For those playing along at home, that’s 4 minutes ahead of pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the halfway point, the course leveled out and things became “less easy”, as anticipated. I held it together for a few more miles, but by mile 17 things got real. That’s the point where I should have laid on the gas a little, having cruised for the first half of the course. But I hadn’t exactly cruised; I’d been working. A glance at my heart rate through the early miles is evidence of that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/revel-hr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Garmin heart rate chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still had a course-specific pace band in my pocket, and it recommended an 8:48 pace for mile 17. So when I ran an 8:50, it was still an “on-pace” mile. PLUS I had minutes in the bank! But it felt like failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bounced back the next mile, with an 8:01.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the 8:36 at mile 19 was “too slow”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the mental game, and I’m not good at it, I had minutes in the bank, but it just wasn’t easy. I wanted it to be easy. I tried to reason with myself: this was for my Mom. This was bigger than me. But that actually made me feel worse: I’d stop running because I felt so emotionally depleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so within that last 10K, I lost my minutes of buffer, and many minutes more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M20: 9:19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/revel-later.png&quot; alt=&quot;Woman running with a focused look on her face&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I was walking up the street when my pacer ran by me. He said something over his shoulder that I didn’t hear – but he was on his own and he didn’t stop. I’m pretty sure 3:40 was still doable, so I’m not sure why he didn’t try to keep his “group” motivated and on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M21: 9:24
M22: 9:35&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, I texted my Mom and Sara and said “I’m sorry, I can’t do it”. Then I put my phone on “do not disturb” so as not to get their responses. I hoped this would be an psychological trick on myself: that it’d give me a kick in the pants to motivate me and try to ‘prove myself wrong’. It didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M23: 9:53
M24: 10:45&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must have been the point where I just decided I’d walk it in. If I wasn’t gonig to run Boston with my Mom, I really didn’t care how I did. I saw a runner clutching her leg on the side of the road, with some medical assistance helping her. I heard them saying “get her some water”. I stopped to talk with someone “if she’s cramping, I have salt tabs”. The person said I could go ahead and keep doing my race, but I said it didn’t matter. I fished out some salt tabs from my pack. About 10 min later, an ambulance came roaring up the road. If it was for that runner, I hope she’s ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M25: 10:00
M26: 10:39&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, I still came in at 3:48:10, which is the fastest marathon I’ve completed this year. And I did that after completely giving up. But that old rule of thumb, that for every minute you’re ahead at the half, you give up double on the second half? It held true. 4 minutes ahead at the half, and I missed my goal by 8 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/revel-raceanalysis.png&quot; alt=&quot;Revel Chilliwack Race Analysis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I’m disappointed in myself for a few reasons. Giving up, for sure. That’s my typical MO when I have a target time goal. I buckle under the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more than that, I’m disappointed with what I did during the first half of the race. I KNOW BETTER. I knew I wasn’t in 3:30 shape, there was zero reason for me to be banking that much time. I blindly listened to a pacer (who, honestly, was kinda a jerk and obviously not pacing for the right reasons). I know myself, and honestly I’ve probably run more marathons than a lot of people out there. Yet because he’s ‘the pacer’, I blindly followed his guidance rather than listening to my body and my own plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really think I blew it. Obviously I can’t tell for sure, but I suspect that if I’d been a bit more conservative earlier on, I wouldn’t have felt so emotionally depleted nearer the end. And now I don’t get to run with my Mom in Boston in 2020 🙁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But – it is what it is. I knew it was a bit of a long shot to qualify without actually TRAINING for it. I’ve been really fortunate for my running career that I have been able to qualify for and run Boston so many times. This was a nice reminder that qualifying for Boston is a BIG DEAL. You’re not supposed to be able to ‘cram’ for it like a test and do it. It makes my Mom’s accomplishment even more special! So, provided she does register, I’ll get to play spectator for my Mom and cheer her on. It’ll be her special day 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Sara asked me how I was feeling about running. Honestly, I felt more bad about the fact we spent a lot of money (and precious vacation days) flying across the country for this exploit. But the following day we went up to Squamish, went for a run and saw some of the Squamish 50K finishers, and had a wonderful day. More than the marathon barreling down the highway, that day filled me with love for running and sense of gratitude. The day in Squamish made the trip worthwhile, in my mind. Although I still have my “50 marathons in 50 states” goal, and I know I obviously still have things to learn when it comes to race execution, it was good reminder of the majesty of trail running. We decided we definitely want to come back to Squamish, and try to spend more time out in nature on the trails. Run to be one with nature, not to try to beat a clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/revel-smilingafter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Woman smiling at the end of a marathon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, that pacer – did I mention that he finished in 3:36?? That’s right. When he blew by me and didn’t pause to gather his flock, it wasn’t because I wasn’t able to hold onto a 3:40 finish. He was still going too fast, and so he didn’t pace anyone. He finished by himself – hope he enjoyed his free race. Revel – I really recommend you don’t accept pacers who aren’t in it to encourage others and help them get to the finish.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrea Hill</name></author><summary type="html">My Mom has been trying to qualify for Boston, and I’d always said that if she qualified, I’d register and run with her.

&lt;p&gt;May 26th I ran the Ottawa marathon in the morning, and jumped on a plane in the afternoon to head to Toronto for a month. I’ve accepted a fellowship with Code for Canada that included a month of onboarding in Toronto. That wrapped up June 21st, when I jumped on ANOTHER plane to Duluth, MN to participate in Grandma’s marathon. Then it was back to Ottawa to start a new job. Sadly, a few weeks have already passed since then, but I definitely want to be sure I write up a report!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off: I’ve wanted to run Grandma’s forever! At least since 2006 or so, when I was still back in Ohio. It took moving to Canada to finally commit! We registered on the opening day of registration, back in October or so. Sara registered for the half, and Andrea and a few of her Denver friends registered for the marathon (similar group as ran Marine Corps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara and I had initially planned to fly to Minneapolis on the Thursday before the (Saturday) race, but when I accepted my new job, there was the expectation I’d be in Toronto until Friday afternoon. So, I booked a new flight direct from Toronto to Duluth Friday night, planning to arrive around 10pm. Sara kept her existing travel arrangements, including a solo two-hour drive from Minneapolis to Duluth in part because someone needed to pick up the race bibs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some major fomo when the group texts started rolling in on Thurs/Friday from the folks in Duluth, but soon enough I was on my way. There was a slight hiccup with our crew arriving late for the Duluth flight, but they assured us we’d get there “sometime this evening”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/grandmas-plane.png&quot; alt=&quot;A running book and a runners world magazine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did end up arriving in Duluth around our scheduled time, and I think I got into our hotel room close to 10:45. Sara had her alarm set for 3:45 for her bus to the start, but she’d laid out everything we each needed for the morning. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her alarm went off early, and I got up with her. Our hotel was a pickup hotel for the buses to the start of the marathon, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the half-marathon. So we had a 2 mile drive to drop her off at her pickup hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logistics between the half and the marathon was really the one big drawback of this race. The half marathon started nearly 2 hours before the marathon, so they had to get up earlier. The bus pickups were at different places. And of course, Sara finished running about the time we started, so had to wait for hours for we marathoners to finish. So much of this race weekend was SO well done, this was just perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I dropped Sara off, I went back to the hotel and laid down for about another 45 min. Then it was pretty nice to just walk outside to grab the bus. The hotel we stayed at, the Best Western Bridgeview, was awesome! They had early breakfast and grab n go bags. They gave us maps and snacks at checkin. It’s obvious that this race weekend is a big deal to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bus, I sat next to a local runner. He’d completed the race four or five times before, and pointed out the finish as we rode by. I told him I wanted to run a ‘smarter’ race than Ottawa, and I’d likely start around the four hour group and reassess at the midway point. He had a similar plan; he was going to start with the 3:50 group and see how things went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portapotty lines at the start were already huge when we arrived at the starting area. I saw Andrea briefly in a separate line, but there wasn’t really time to chat before it was time to drop our bags and line up at the start! I did stop by a medical tent set up at the start where they had sunscreen, vasoline and I think even some KT-tape. How smart!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wearing my marathon maniacs tank, my new balance shorts and my nike zoom flys. I carried a handbottle of water, in part to faciliate carrying fruit-2 and salt tabs. I had my phone in the pocket of my shorts, but didn’t even bring headphones. I never used to run with music, and sometimes I feel like it’s overly distracting; it pushes me too much out of my natural flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren’t official corrals, just signposts advising people about paces. It was hard to weave my way up from the back, so eventually a just stopped (I think a bit behind the 4-hr group) and decided I’d find my right pace as we went along. The weather was great; up until a few days before the race the forecast had been for heavy rain, but the skies were clear!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things are always hard to write after a few weeks have passed, but I can say that this race felt good. I ran comfortable, even telling myself (and listening!) to ease up in the early miles. I wanted to be around an 8:45 pace well into the race, and then if I felt like picking it up later, great. I didn’t want to push too hard early on, because that death march is so demoralizing at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I’ve wanted to run Grandma’s for over a decade. It’s a classic in the marathon circuit, and they did a lot of things right. Every mile they didn’t just have a small mile marker sign, they had giant chains of balloons you could see from afar. They were great motivators!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day ended up a little warm, and I was careful to stay hydrated. At many water stops I’d stop and have them top up my handheld bottle. I also was careful to take salt tabs – I definitely saw a few people off to the side looking like they were cramping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course paralleled the lake, and we were offered some beautiful views as we ran. It reminded me a lot of Lake Tahoe – except I actually preferred this course. There was great crowd support; we saw some of the same folks moving along the course. In a throwback to my earlier race days, I partook of offered twizzlers and beer along the way. We’re here to have fun, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I felt pretty good throughout, though I will admit it took a bit more effort near the end. For one thing, WHY IS THE BIGGEST ELEVATION CHANGE IN THE LAST THREE MILES???!?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d been pretty lucky wind-wise throughout (given it’s a point-to-point course, that can really make or break a race!), until we got to the final few turns right in Duluth. I made one turn and felt as though I’d run into a wall, the wind was so strong. Ugh! I’d been pretty good at chugging along, only stopping to walk briefly over one hill, but I definitely walked at the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I didn’t have a time goal for this race. I wanted to feel good throughout. Based on my (5K) splits, I’d say I achieved that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/grandmas-raceanalysis.png&quot; alt=&quot;Race Analysis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty even splits throughout!
Yes, so that’s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5K: 27:14
10K: 27:07
15K: 27:14
20K: 26:27
25K: 27:07
30K: 27:05
35K: 27:40
40K: 27:38&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I rolled in at 3:50:40, or an 8:48 pace. 15 minutes faster than the marathon I ran 4 weeks prior! I’ll take it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara and I met up at the end (she is SO GOOD at finding me after races!!), and waited around to meet up with Andrea and her friends. We chatted for a bit before we all split up to grab a snack and clean up before the evening events: we had tickets on the Pizza Train! This was a great way for us to relax and chat after the race. There were about 11 of us; marathoners, half-marathoners, spouses and an 8 year old. Ya know, sitting on a scenic train for a couple hours (especially one that provides pizza and sells beer) is a pretty great idea after a race!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/grandmas-pizzatrain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sara, me, and Andrea on the North Shore Scenic Railroad Pizza Train after Grandma’s Marathon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the inconvenience of the scheduling of the half- and full marathoners, this was a superbly organized race. The town really seemed to embrace it, and the course was pretty and runner-friendly. Sure, it was a bit challenging to get there from Ottawa, but I’m glad that this was my Minnesota race!&lt;/p&gt;

Well, they are.. but not by as much as you may have assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my marathon spreadsheet, I organize my races by finish time. The burgundy bars are different time-buckets. The green lines are races I’ve run since I turned 40. Notice how all of them are in that 4-5hr range, and they make up roughly half of all the races I’ve completed in that range over my running career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/masters-running.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is where the caveats come in. That includes the three marathons of the Tahoe Triple, pacing my Mom to a sub-five hour race, and the Boston Monsoon of 2018. But still – just looking at the list, there’s a lot of green all clumped together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading into the Marine Corps marathon, I didn’t let that weigh me down. I was ready to train well, run comfortable and let my body dictate what I was capable of. &lt;a href=&quot;/gothedistance/2018-11-02-marine-corps-marathon-2018-race-report/&quot;&gt;And it went great&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrea Hill</name></author><summary type="html">If you were to look at my race results since I rolled into the Masters category (age 40+, as of Aug 2017), you’d probably surmise my best running days were behind me.

&lt;p&gt;The Marine Corps Marathon was great!! It’s been on my bucket list for awhile, and when my friend Andrea from Colorado texted me to say “I got peer pressured into another marathon” I knew I had to throw my hat in the ring and see if I could get in via lottery. Spoiler: I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been awhile since I focused my training, so I was eager to do that this summer. I started with trying to follow a Pfitzinger plan, but I was pretty spotty on all the workouts. I’d pick and choose, but ultimately decided I wasn’t really prepared to dive into a full-on “advanced marathoning” training plan. I am really trying to be more kind to myself. I know I’m not the runner I used to be, and so I really wanted to forgive myself and recapture my love for marathoning. Ultimately I spend a lot of time and money at this hobby, so I may as well enjoy it and not get all stressed about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, training went pretty well. I had some super training runs – including a scheduled 15 miler that became close to an 18 miler since I felt so good and loved the route. That’s always a good sign! 🙂 As well as a bit of yoga and chiropractic, I felt pretty strong going into the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara and I arrived in DC on Thursday, and met our friend Andrea from Colorado for dinner. It was great to catch up – we miss her! The next morning we went to the race expo and picked up an amazingly tacky race shirt. Participants also received a patch, and it was really cool to see folks walking around the expo with MCM jackets and vests on, covered with patches. We wandered the area for a bit, and then headed back into the city – to visit another running shop 🙂 After that, we headed back to the Airbnb to relax a bit before heading over to my friend Natalie’s for dinner. Natalie is a friend from Columbus, although I’ve only seen her twice since I moved away – once in 2009 when I was playing roller derby in Baltimore, and then in 2013 when we went on a trip to Panama together. We’ve each met and married our wives since then, so it was fun to make those introductions.  It’s like we’re grown-ups now! 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday it was pouring when we got up and started sightseeing. We went to the Holocaust museum (particularly tragic when we found out that there had been an attack on a synagogue in the US on that day!), and then met with Andrea and her friends to do a hop-on, hop-off bus tour for awhile. After a late lunch we stopped by another running store, and then went our separate ways to get ready for the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had booked an airbnb that was one stop away from the race start (for me) and two stops away from the finish. The race was set to start at 7:55, but they recommended to get there 90 min early to go through security, etc. We left our airbnb at 6:20, stopped by starbucks and were on our way! Sara had further to go for her 10K start, but they weren’t anticipating the same congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was forecast to be in the 50s, so I wore a tank top,  New Balance shorts, a Colorado buff and my Nike Zoom flys. These shoes are the bomb! I wore a stuff bra with brix maple syrup fuel, and some xact nutrition chews. Look at me, with the Canadian fuel sources 🙂 I also carried my phone in my shorts pocket for after, and wore my boston marathon space blanket and arm sleeves to the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited for over a half hour for a portapotty at the start, and then sped through the runners village parking lot to drop off my bag and head right to the start. Because I had NO time to wait around, I took off my space blanket and armsleeves and checked them. Honestly, it was a bit of a disaster at the start, much less organized than I would have expected. I just barely made it jogging to my corral (3:30-3:59) for the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that Othman from Denver was pacing the 3:45 pace group, and I was toying with running with that group, but I didn’t see the group at the start. But I was ok with that, because I really just wanted to feel good running this race. I had been reading Deena Kastor’s “Let Your Mind Run” book on the plane, and I really just wanted to feel gratitude and power through this run, rather than weighing myself down with any negative thoughts or worries. As such, I also didn’t bring my headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/Deena_Kastor_on_Twitter___Make_it_a_great_race_…__.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen capture of a tweet from Deena Kastor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, HOW FREAKING COOL IS THIS? Deena Kastor wished me a good race??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I NEVER used to run with headphones, but over the past few years I’ve started doing it more. I wanted to return to that place of running and being connected with the event and the people around me and my own energy, rather than trying to hide behind it, or “borrow” the energy of the music to propel me forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, ok, so the actual running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s a marathon, so do I remember a lot of it.. sorta 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember that there were a LOT of people for the first few miles. It was tough to get into a cadence. That was ok at the start, though, since the first few miles were uphill. It allowed me to run nice and comfortable. It was really nice to not really have a target pace, and just to run as I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of handcycles and disabled athletes in this race, which always makes me very emotional. I’d definitely like to find out if there is an Achilles group in Ottawa I can be part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started in the 3:30-3:49 corral, I was pretty surprised to come up on the 4:15 pace group around mile 5! Overall I felt pretty good and just kept trucking along. I would glance at my watch from time to time, but I never used it to really adjust anything. I let my body dictate my pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://en.brixalerable.ca/attachments/Image/thumbnail_2doses_3.jpg?template=generic&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;147&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about the Brix fluid is that it’s in a closeable container. So unlike a gel package that gets sticky and gooey, I could close this and put it back in my bra. Not sure what spectators thought, but it was convenient for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took in gatorade during the course, and felt pretty good throughout. They were giving out carboom at mile 13 and mile 23 (or so). I took one small amount and was instantly sorry. It was really think and sickly sweet. I’ll stick to my syrup! 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best known parts of the Marine Corps Marathon is mile 12, known as “the blue mile”. You’re on a pretty isolated part of the course away from spectators, and they line the path with photographs of fallen officers. It was pretty sobering, and I was appreciative that even the runners around me stopped chatting during this time, out of respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then right after the blue mile, we entered a section lined with American flags and excited volunteers hooting and hollering. It was really well done – it helped amp up the runners and had an ambience of hope and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on spectators, this course was pretty great. Tons of folks out there cheering, and some great signs. Most notable were those that poked fun at the shirts we got –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“you trained five months for THAT SHIRT”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(at mile 22) “You still look better than that shirt”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Smile! You may be on next year’s shirt”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ha! Maybe it was on purpose – a momento that brought us together 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/1__Andrea_F_Hill.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Before starting the race, Sara had told me to smile wide and gesture at the photographers, which I did. It definitely reflected how I felt inside, and it was great to express it. I do so love marathons. Not to say I did it, but just because I CAN. I can get up, lace on shoes, and keep my body moving at a decent clip for HOURS. That’s pretty freaking cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The miles ticked by, and I was thrilled around mile 16 to have that feeling of “only 10 miles to go!” Unlike some races where I go out too aggressively and I feel a drain on my energy and abilities, I felt like I could run forever. I was definitely in a comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I found annoying, that threw me off a bit, was that we passed the start of the 10K at mile 18. So here’s the thing. 10K is 6.2 miles. The two races ended at the same place. So I was left wondering where we were going to make up the extra two miles, and why we couldn’t just run the same course as the 10Kers. For whatever reason, this really bugged me. Ah well – I guess if that’s all I have to worry about at mile 18 of a marathon, I’m going ok!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran over this huge bridge (sign leading onto the bridge – “I cannot tell a lie  – this bridge sucks!”) and then turned into Crystal City. At this point it was actually starting to get a little warm, and I was glad I was in a tank and shorts, unlike some people who were in long sleeves and tights (!!?!). In a few out-and-back pieces I’d seen the 3:45 pace group (oh yes, at some point I passed the 4 hours group), and I knew I wasn’t going to catch them. Again – I wasn’t racing to try to achieve a certain time; I really wanted to finish this race feeling good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran through the starting area, which had been so dark three and a half hours before. I didn’t love that, but at least it was somewhat familiar. And soon enough, I could hear the announcers up ahead. I made the final left turn onto an uphill. I’d gone the entire race without stopping (except during one water stop) but I’ll tell you, that hill was dumb! But I was close to being finished so I mustered whatever I had left and headed into the finishing chute. Done! I knew I’d missed 3:45, but not by much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(My official finishing time was 3:46:56)
&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images//Marine_Corps_Marathon___Run___Strava.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got my medal and the thin finishers jacket (not much more substantial than a space blanket), I turned to walk through the athletes area and there was Sara waiting for me. She’s really really great at spotting me at finish lines, for which I’m terribly grateful. I was feeling ok, just slow. We got me some water and I picked up my checked bag, where I ran into Othman. He’d brought his group in at 3:44:5x. Pretty perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I had other friends running, Sara and I were both fading fast, so we decided to head back to our airbnb. I was pleasantly surprised that my feet and legs felt great, and I had really run a strong run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes – as I said on facebook, this run felt like one from a decade ago. I ran my race, soaked in the atmosphere and let my body do what it was capable of. Looking at my splits, I ran an incredibly even paced race – my first mile was the slowest (9:15), and my fastest was at mile 19 (8:12)??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5K: 28:27&lt;br /&gt;
10K: 26:36&lt;br /&gt;
15K: 26:26&lt;br /&gt;
20K: 25:35&lt;br /&gt;
25K: 26:03&lt;br /&gt;
30K: 25:47&lt;br /&gt;
35K: 26:17&lt;br /&gt;
40K: 26:55&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m so thrilled at how it went, but also a little surprised? I know there is so much more I could have done in terms of training, cross-training, or recovery. Yet the ole body apparently knows what to do.. maybe especially when I let my mind lead the way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I had a breakthrough marathon when I was training with a coach 6 years ago, I really suffered with insecurities and deflated expectations afterwards. This race really made me feel like I may be over it. Part of it included adding “Masters PRs” to my blog. As of last year, my records reset. I am proud of this race, but I know I can also improve on it. And I will! Not because this wasn’t good enough, but because I know I am capable of more, and I’m eager to see what my body and mind will lead me to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, great race. I can’t wait til the next one! (So far I don’t have anything scheduled til May. Think I can wait that long??!?!?)s&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrea Hill</name></author><summary type="html">After 48 of these things, I think I’m getting the hang of them!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wow, number 50 is around the corner!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/gothedistance/wow-number-50-is-around-the-corner/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wow, number 50 is around the corner!" /><published>2018-10-21T19:50:41-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-21T19:50:41-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/gothedistance/wow-number-50-is-around-the-corner</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gothedistance/wow-number-50-is-around-the-corner/">&lt;p&gt;Next weekend is the Marine Corps Marathon, which will be my 50th Marathon+!  Why the ‘+’? Well, I’ve done two 50Ks and I include them in that count. Two races from now, I may drop the ‘+’ and celebrate again, we’ll see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading up to this one, I’ve gone back and forth on goal-setting, and finally came to the conclusion that I need to stop worrying about it. Back when I lived in Ohio, I ran a lot of marathons, and I loved it. I just went out and did it, and did well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really once I joined a training group in Colorado that I started not enjoying running as much. Interestingly, I joined them in November after a strong self-coached half marathon, ran a huge PR in January and then kinda fizzled out after that. I tried to switch to focus on ‘speed at the half distance’, suffered an injury and haven’t been the same since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I haven’t approached races accepting that.. which makes for kinda a tough time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ran Houston in 2012, my coach had advised me to go out at a &lt;a href=&quot;/gothedistance/houston-marathon-plan/&quot;&gt;faster pace than I thought possible&lt;/a&gt;. His recommendation was to ‘start with the 3:10 group and gauge how I’m feeling, how I can always see how I feel and if it’s not my day, I can relax and let the 3:20 group catch me. His sense is that if I try to go with the 3:20 group and then pick it up near the end (what I was planning), that I will be dodging a lot of folks at the end and wondering if I could have done better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, I ran a 20 min PR and amazed everyone except maybe that coach. I’ve tried that technique since then (go out and see how I feel), but it really hasn’t been what I’d consider a success. Maybe b/c at that race I was definitely open to the idea of doing the slower pace, whereas since then its b/c I wanted/expected to keep up with that faster pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result has been a lot of positive splits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NYCM (Nov 2014): 1:46 / 3:38&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eugene (May 2016) 1:42 / 3:37&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maui (Jan 2017): 1:49 / 3:47&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Harmon Lake Trail marathon (June 2017): 1:57 / 4:07&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boston (April 2018): 2:03 / 4:19&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ottawa Race Weekend Half (May): :53 /  1:49&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except from the &lt;a href=&quot;/gothedistance/2016-05-02-eugene-marathon-race-report/&quot;&gt;Eugene race report&lt;/a&gt;: “I wonder if I should have been more conservative: could I have done a whole 26.2 miles at an 8mm rather than 18 miles at 7:48, 2 at 8:15 and then 5 at 9:30. ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, just looking at those in order like that may also seem like I’m just plain ole getting slower, but I omitted Jack and Jill from that list b/c it didn’t have a negative split 🙂 The fact is, for Eugene, Maui and the Ottawa half, I started out at a pace I just wasn’t able to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… why?? I used to just run, and love it. I’d love the feeling of comradery, and accomplishment. I am never, ever going to run anywhere near 3:09 anymore, and I actually don’t care to qualify for Boston again, so why does it even matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I just need to go out and enjoy it. Honestly, a lot of my runs lately I pick it up over time, so I think I just need to go out more conservatively and see how it goes, and enjoy it more. Because that’s why I do this… because I love running 26.2 miles at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I say that.. but Marine Corps is next Sunday, and I’ve already seen that a guy I know from Denver is one of the pace leaders for the 3:45 pace group…. Should I? Gah, I’m such a hypocrite! 😛&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrea Hill</name></author><summary type="html">Next weekend is the Marine Corps Marathon, which will be my 50th Marathon+!  Why the ‘+’?

But last year when Meredith mentioned that the race date fell on her 40th birthday, it seemed as good a reason as ever to make the pilgrimmage back to this marathoner’s mecca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I qualified at the &lt;a href=&quot;/jack-and-jill-downhill-marathon-2017-race-report/&quot;&gt;Jack and Jill race&lt;/a&gt; last July, with a nice big buffer for my age group (the joy of aging up?!?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training for Boston was … negligible. The &lt;a href=&quot;/tahoe-triple-race-report-bucket-list-item-complete/&quot;&gt;Tahoe Triple&lt;/a&gt; took a lot out of me last October, and then my training never really got back on track as Sara and I made plans and moved up to Canada in early 2018. I’ve struggled with a lot of knee pain, specifically, and there was a TON of snow up here when we got here! Sure, I managed a nice &lt;a href=&quot;/mesa-phx-marathon-2018-race-report/&quot;&gt;26.2 long run&lt;/a&gt; with my Mom in AZ in February, but apart from that I don’t think I’d run over 12 miles since October!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, a few weeks ago I started to go to a chiropractor here and it has seriously changed my life!  My posture is better and he has even done some work to correct my weird inward-facing left foot, as well as work on the popliteus muscle behind my knees. Knee pain is gone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, if I can do three marathons in three days at altitude in Tahoe, I knew I could do Boston. Plus, as Meredith reminded me via text, this is a bonus marathon. The hard part is getting there, and then you have nothing to prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sentiment was even more appreciated as the weather forecast came up: 20-30mph winds and rain. Yuck! I declared on facebook that I was expecting that to slow me down a good 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Andrea_F_Hill.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-5261&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Andrea_F_Hill-1024x552.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Andrea_F_Hill-1024x552.png 1024w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Andrea_F_Hill-300x162.png 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Andrea_F_Hill-768x414.png 768w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Andrea_F_Hill.png 1028w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it was Boston, which is always special! Sara and I flew down Friday (there are direct flights from Ottawa! Amazing!), and went for a nice run through Cambridge on Saturday. I hadn’t realized we couldn’t check gear backs in Hopkinton, so we bought some throwaway clothes at Goodwill. I bought a ridiculous pajama nightgown thing I figured would keep me warm before we started running. We enjoyed a relaxing day before meeting Meredith, Dave and Anderson at the expo. We then all grabbed dinner together. It was fun to catch up (the last time we saw each other was after the Pikes Peak Ascent a few years ago).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-5264&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Yes, I ran a marathon in this!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I’d seen at the Expo were magnets for holding your bib in place without pins, and I decided that would be good for the race so I didn’t make holes in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://ultimatedirection.com/womens-ultra-jacket-v2/&quot;&gt;AMAZING ULTIMATE DIRECTION ULTRA JACKET&lt;/a&gt; . I have worn this thing almost every run since we moved to Canada, since it’s wind- and water-proof. So Sunday morning we ran back to the expo (1.5 miles) so I could pick it up, and I also ended up getting a &lt;a href=&quot;http://theroosport.com/&quot;&gt;RooSport pouch&lt;/a&gt; to carry my phone. I used to have a flipbelt, but hate how it always rode up.  We bought a box of Honey Stinger waffles too before remembering we had to run back home carrying all this stuff. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last big trip was to the Nike store. I’ve read a ton about the shoes they developed for the Breaking2 initiative and wanted to see the models they’ve released for the public. I tried on the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.runningshoesguru.com/2017/12/nike-zoom-fly-review/&quot;&gt;Zoom Fly&lt;/a&gt; and was pleasantly surprised at how good they felt. They did feel like they were offering forward momentum, like a Newton except without the lugs. Funny to think that I bought my first pair of Newtons the last time I ran Boston, way back in 2009.. but suffice to say, I have a pair of Zoom Fly waiting to be taken out on their maiden voyage now 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, race day. The bus system is SO much better than it used to be: Meredith and I were in the third wave, which meant we were to take the bus to Hopkinton between 8-8:45. We’d leave the Athletes’ village at 10:05 for a 10:50 start, so there weren’t hours and hours to wait in Hopkinton. Good thing because there was torrential rain, and you couldn’t check a gear back from Hopkinton. Meredith had been prepared and brought throw-away shoes, socks, pants and a sweatshirt. I definitely didn’t…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;BeforetheRace.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our airbnb was about 1.5 miles from the bus loading zone, so Sara and I jogged there. I had on my injinji compression toesocks, hokas, capris, a long-sleeved shirt, my fleece nightgown, a buff and my UD jacket. I’d bought some gardening gloves at 7-11 the day before but they were soaked by the time we met the Gordons to get on the bus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus ride itself was uneventful, but it gave Meredith and I some good catching-up time. Hard to believe we’ve known each other for over 13 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athlete’s Village was basically a mudpit. Ugh. I had thought I’d take off the fleece nightgown to run, but there was really no good way to do tha without getting wet under my jacket. So, I decided to just run in it! I fiddled with my phone, headphones and RooSport a bit before the race – definitely didn’t need to be trying to figure all this out on race day, which it was raining (we were huddled under a giant tent, but it was still wet and cold).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;onto-the-race&quot;&gt;Onto the Race!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Boston_Marathon___Run___Strava.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First few miles of Boston are downhill, and of course you’re caught up in the energy of the crowd. I had qualified with a 3:29 but knew there was no way I was going to run anywhere near that for this race. Still, my first mile ticked by with an 8:45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t thought about how my headphones were going to work with my fleece nightgown, so in the second mile my headphones came loose. I was trying to fix them and re-arrange my phone, when I dropped my credit card. Then I took my phone out and tried to put it in the inside pocket of my jacket.. and it fell out completely! Apparently my inside pocket isn’t a pocket??!?!? I kept going awkwardly until I realized I no longer had my credit card. Crap! I turned back to look for it (thankfully I’d been on the edge of the course and could turn and go backwards without being too distracting to the sea of runners behind me).  One runner asked if I was looking for a credit card, and directed me backwards to a specific spot. Thank goodness! Anyway, that was the third mile. Ooof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M1: 8:45&lt;br /&gt;
M2: 9:44&lt;br /&gt;
M3: 10:34&lt;br /&gt;
M4: 8:38&lt;br /&gt;
M5: 9:10&lt;br /&gt;
M6: 8:53&lt;br /&gt;
M7: 8:58&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the credit card-phone mishap, I was pleasantly surprised how the next 5K went. I knew that I shouldn’t expect to keep up sub-9 min miles for the whole race – I didn’t necessarily have the endurance, and those darned Newton Hills – but it was doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I used to tell myself that everything should feel completely effortless until mile 8.  In this race, this may have been when the rain and wind picked up. But I’ll admit to a point where I was thinking that I didn’t need to be out here. I have nothing to prove. Thankfully, knowing Sara was out there in the rain, and she’d be excited to be there for me while I ran (and finished…) the Boston marathon kept me going. It’s not that I couldn’t do it.. I just wasn’t particularly enjoying it. I definitely flirted with the idea of calling and Uber 😛&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M8: 9:41&lt;br /&gt;
M9: 9:13&lt;br /&gt;
M10: 9:45&lt;br /&gt;
M11: 9:19&lt;br /&gt;
M12: 9:37&lt;br /&gt;
M13: 9:26 – given the conditions and the credit card mishap, I was pretty ok with a half time of 2:04!&lt;br /&gt;
M14: 9:57&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-5267&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    How ridiculous is this???
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whether or not it was a great choice, I had been listening to an audiobook about the Golden State Killer. Yeah… now that I reflect on it, definitely not the most uplifting thing to read about while running in poor weather… but all of a sudden during mile 15, the audiobook stopped. Huh? I saw a portapotty up ahead (with no line!) and jumped in.  My phone had turned off. I turned it back on. Battery at 1%. Well crap! I had planned on using this phone to meet up with Sara at the end! Ah well. Couldn’t worry about that now. I took out my headphones and got back on the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apparently also stopped my watch at this time. [Amateur]. But that just meant I didn’t have anything to try to do mental math off of. Which was ok with me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M15: 14:52&lt;br /&gt;
M16: 9:45&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the Newton Hills. They actually didn’t seem too bad, perhaps since I’d been running relatively conservatively for the first part of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M17: 10:16&lt;br /&gt;
M18: 10:03&lt;br /&gt;
M19: 10:58&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are they done? I can’t never remember where the hills end, and this year the inflatable wall wasn’t on the top of the last hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M20: 10:04&lt;br /&gt;
M21: 10:41 – did a quick reset of my watch to get it back onto the mile markers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, by mile 21 I know they’re done. Sweet! Only 5 more downhill miles til the finish! And my quads are definitely not trashed like they’ve been in past years… though looking at my pace, it wasn’t like I picked it up a ton. I just didn’t feel like I was on a death march..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M22: 9:50&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I ran past some spectators holding a sign that said “Women’s Winner: Desi”. I stopped and turned back to ask them “Are you serious???” They said yes, and that gave me a huge grin and somewhat of a spring in my step as I continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M23: 10:10&lt;br /&gt;
M24: 10:10&lt;br /&gt;
M25: 10:03&lt;br /&gt;
M26: 9:54&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did the last .2 go? No idea.. right after the portapotty, I guess??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall official time: 4:19:08, for an average pace of 9:53.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt great to run down Boylston. I was amazed at how many spectators there were during this weather! I crossed the line, and wandered through the chute. I felt ok, though of course it got cold once I had slowed to a walk. Grabbed a food bag and made my way to the exit. I was trying to figure out how best to meet Sara. I had thought I’d try to turn my phone on and text her to come find me, but before I could do that, she ran up. She’d seen me in the final stretch and tracked me though the chute. Thank goodness!! I was so grateful for her tenacity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We grabbed the train back to our airbnb where I had a fantastic hot shower and marvelled at the fact that I didn’t seem to be chafed anywhere (that came later). Not my best, but not my worst. The time was within my expected window of 4:15 – 4:30 given the conditions, and that’s without the credit card and dying-phone mishaps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So of course, I’m already chomping at the bit wondering how I’d do if I actually got back to training! I have the Marine Corps Marathon this fall (Yes!! I got in!!!), but I sorta doubt I’ll be able to wait that long. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

She finished in &lt;a href=&quot;/gothedistance/california-international-marathon-race-report/&quot;&gt;5:03:39&lt;/a&gt;, just slightly slower than her 4:59:59 goal. Although completing a marathon at all is a huge accomplishment, she had her sights on covering the distance at a certain pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having to run NYCM alone (I broke my leg when we were scheduled to run it together in 2013), &lt;a href=&quot;gothedistance/chicago-marathon-2015-race-report/&quot;&gt;cramping in Chicago 2015&lt;/a&gt; and DNSing Mesa-Phx in 2017, my Mom and I were focused on achieving her goal at the Mesa-Phx Marathon in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler: we did it! In plenty of time; she ran a 4:58:25! And I’m so grateful I was able to run with her and help her meet her goal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-5257&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photo.jpg 640w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photo-200x300.jpg 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Mom said she was going to try to break-5 at Mesa-Phx, I immediately told her I’d love to run with her, and she was thrilled. When Sara and I decided to move from Denver to Ottawa in early Feb she told me it was ok if it wasn’t feasible, but I didn’t want to miss the chance to share this experience with her. So Thursday afternoon I started my 8+ hrs of travel to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year my parents spent 3 months in AZ (in the past they’ve spent 5) and I hadn’t had a chance to visit them. It was fun to spend that time together and get a bit of sun. On Friday we drove the course and attended the expo. My Mom seemed calm and confident, which was great. This year she incorporated yoga into her recovery routine and it seemed to be going great for her. We knew she was strong when she set a 10K PR a few weeks ago, and this was known to be a fast course. Just check out that profile!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/course_elevation_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Race elevation profile with an aggressive downhill&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dinner the night before the race we had brown rice, teriyaki veggies and black beans. It was good and hearty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning we had to get up at 3 because the last bus to the start line was at 4:45. We’d bought warm-up clothes at Goodwill and were nice and comfortable traveling to the start. The bus drivers stayed at the start line until the beginning of the race, which was wonderful. There were heat lamps and bonfires, but except for a portapotty break we stayed on the bus until just a few moments before the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was slightly cool, so I started the race with a hooded sweatshirt over my tank top, shorts and injinji compression socks. I wore the pack bra and carried honeystinger bites and huma gels. I also carried water: in my mind it was for Mom, but I definitely ended up using it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing these reports is as much for me as for anyone else (probably moreso). I had reviewed my reports from the CIM and Chicago, and saw the pacing strategy we’d used in Chicago. I decided we should follow it here. This strategy has you go slightly faster than race pace for the first half, anticipating slowing down the last 10K. This was also a perfect strategy for this race, which has a more aggressive downhill at the beginning of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first few miles, I kept saying to my Mom that we were going too fast! We were often running around a 10:40 pace. My pacing strategy said to go 11mm for the first 13.1 miles. I was conflicted; did we want to slow ourselves down or take advantage of the course profile? Ultimately I told my Mom to let me know: if she felt she was pushing AT ALL, we would slow. But otherwise, we’d let the course pull us and dictate the pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M1: 10:24&lt;br /&gt;
M2: 10:19&lt;br /&gt;
M3: 10:51&lt;br /&gt;
M4: 10:19 (wayy too fast!)&lt;br /&gt;
M5: 11:19&lt;br /&gt;
M6: 12:08&lt;br /&gt;
M7: 10:20&lt;br /&gt;
M8: 10:48&lt;br /&gt;
M9:10:34&lt;br /&gt;
M10: 10:29&lt;br /&gt;
M11: 10:41&lt;br /&gt;
M12: 10:37&lt;br /&gt;
M13: 13:39&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren’t a ton of portapotties on the course, which normally wouldn’t matter, but today it did. I felt like I had to go to the bathroom for several miles, but I told Mom I wasn’t willing to wait in a line. Every moment counts when you have a time goal! Eventually my Mom said she had to stop, and thankfully we were coming up to the halfway point and there were tons of portapotties. She jumped right in! We still lost a couple minutes, but it was ok since we’d banked a couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing strategy from Chicago said that you should be between 2:19 and 2:27 at the half, with 2:24 being about perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We crossed the halfway point at 2:24:00!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the second stage of pacing kicked off. The plan said it was ok to run 11:25 at this point, but I figured there was no need to force ourselves to slow down if we felt ok. Mom did say she was starting to get a bit tired, so I let her slow down a bit (but not below 11:25 if I could help it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M14: 10:30&lt;br /&gt;
M15: 10:54&lt;br /&gt;
M16: 11:42&lt;br /&gt;
M17: 11:16&lt;br /&gt;
M18: 11:33&lt;br /&gt;
M19: 11:27&lt;br /&gt;
M20: 11:25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had noticed that Mom was pretty happy to walk the water stops, and I tried to encourage her not to waste too much time and walk pretty briskly. I gave her a choice: if we walked water stops, we had to run faster between them. If we kept jogging, we could have a more steady state run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water stops were right after mile markers, which meant a new mile would reset, we’d start off with a pace around a 14mm and then manage to bring it back up to about 11:30 before the mile elapsed and a new water stop would crop up. Although earlier on she walked them, she was great at skipping them if they weren’t needed later in the game. I think we both knew that it’s pretty hard to get started running again after walking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mile 20: 3:42:01 – Pace 11:07&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when we got to the 20 mile mark. Only 10K to go, and it was ok for us to slow our pace more. Mom was definitely tired, but she was great at listening to my *ahem* direction. Every once in awhile she’d want to slow to a walk and I’d tell her “no! We can jog slower, but we’re NOT walking!”, and she’d pick it up again. She was an easy person to guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just giddy. Although our pace slowed these last few miles, I knew we were going to be ok to meet our goal. I kept the mental math going: we could slow to over 13mm and still meet our goal. And were going just slower than 12mm! I wasn’t letting my Mom check her watch (checking your watch is the worst thing to do when you’re tired), but I was thrilled we were keeping the pace pretty steady. We passed quite a few people walking. Sure, Mom wasn’t feeling very energetic, but she was still running and making good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there we were in the last mile, watching for the finish. We saw my Dad on the sidelines, where he excitedly shouted “you’re going to do it!” A minute or so later, the 5 hour pacer came by us. We chatted a bit. She was running based on clock time, and told us it was 4:57 on clock time. She encouraged us to come with her, but Mom was pretty beat and we knew we’d finish sub-5 on chip time. As we neared the finish line, the announcer called out my Mom, and then asked how many marathons she’d run. It was very cool (and a sign of a smallish race) when you can have a convo with the announcer as you run in. Such a great accomplishment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M21: 11:51&lt;br /&gt;
M22: 11:56&lt;br /&gt;
M23: 12:19&lt;br /&gt;
M24: 12:31&lt;br /&gt;
M25: 12:56&lt;br /&gt;
M26: 12:23&lt;br /&gt;
.2: 12:01 pace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(last 10K: 12:20 pace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/timingresults.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Results from a marathon indicating a finish time of 4:58:25&quot; /&gt;
When we finished Chicago in 2015, I had felt like I had to hold onto Mom the last mile or so, I was afraid she was going to pitch forward. Not this time! She was definitely stronger and it was so exciting! We crossed the line, and she immediately lurched towards the medical chairs next to the finish. She sat down while a volunteer brought us some water. She’d given her all, and beat her goal! Her time was &lt;strong&gt;4:58:25, a 3 min PR and her first sub-5 marathon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so exciting to be there with her, as she repeated “I did it. I did it” a few times. She’d beaten a goal she’d set 8 years prior, and we all know how much of a difference age can make when it comes to fitness and athleticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/PRbell.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smiling woman ringing a bell at the end of a race&quot; /&gt;
    Ringing the PR Bell!
  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked through the finisher’s area and her friend Shirley was there to congratulate her. How nice! We enjoyed some post-run food and met up with my Dad. My legs were pretty tight (my left hip and my knees had bothered me in the race), but Mom seemed overall ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No surprise, she’s already talking about the next race she is going to do. She’s definitely not physically beat up, which she chalks up to good training. The question is: what do you do after you achieve a major goal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option: she’s 68, so her Boston qualifying time for 2020 (when she’ll be 70) is 4:55:00. If you take out our 2 minute bathroom break, 4:56:25 isn’t TOO far off 4:55…. So I guess we’ll see if she decides to give that a whirl, or focus more on trail runs. I know she’s not a huge fan of the long training runs that marathons require. But maybe she’d consider just one or two more… 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/gothedistance/assets/images/finishers1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finishers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, it was good to get another long run in. Boston is coming up in a few weeks and I’ve definitely not got a lot of long distances under my belt. It’s funny, since running 3:29 at Jack and Jill in July, my 4 of marathons have been in the 4s, most closer to 5 hrs than 4. So I know my endurance (or at least “unwillingness to quit”) is there, but I’d like to lay more speed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also going to be cleaning up my diet. I’ve gotten pretty lax with gluten and dairy, and I think I’m feeling achy from it. I just used to feel so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, onto the next one!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrea Hill</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">When she turned 60 in 2009, my Mom decided to run her first marathon.

It was in Washington State (a state I didn’t have yet) and was supposed to be beautiful and fast. I was interested, but the timing wasn’t right for last year. She ran the race and told us she’d definitely run it again if we were interested. So when registration opened up (they held the race twice over the weekend since it was so popular), we were quick to register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a run streak in February, so I’ve run at least a mile a day for four months. I also picked up my beloved Pete Pfitzinger “Advanced Marathoning” 55/12 plan to train for this course. I did heart rate monitor training and was feeling pretty strong leading up to the race. I didn’t have a firm time goal, but I thought I’d be happy with 3:35 (an 8:12 pace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this race course is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marathoninvestigation.com/2017/06/tunnel-marathon-controversy.html&quot;&gt;shrouded in controversy&lt;/a&gt;: there are three different race directors who use basically this same course for races. However, I’d heard several people talk about Jack and Jill, and had never heard of the “Light at the End of the Tunnel” marathon. This was reputed to be one of the fastest courses in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no race expo, just a couple tables set up outside a Nike Factory Outlet. We picked up our packets Saturday afternoon. Sara picked up a 2:00 pace band for the half and Andrea picked up a 4:00 pace band for the marathon. I picked up a 3:35 but ultimately decided not to wear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race morning came early: we were assigned the 4:45am bus, and advised to give ourselves 40 minutes from the town we were staying in to get to the parking lot. Thankfully our Airbnb host had provided a toaster so we had gf cinnamon raisin toast and pb, as well as coffee. Because the course was on a trail (gravel, not technical), I wore my hokas, as well as compression socks, lululemon shorts, and a tank top. I carried a water bottle, three huma gels and three salt tabs. I brought my phone and Bluetooth headphones in case I needed some inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;We look under-dressed compared to the other racers, but I think we were the smartest!&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus ride was pretty uneventful; Andrea and I rode up together and listened to some marathon maniacs behind us talking about some other races they’d done. At the start we managed to kill almost the entire 45 minutes waiting in line for the bathroom. Soon enough it was time to line up! I took one of my gels before we got going, and then lined up around the 3:35 pace group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course started in a parking lot but soon went into a 2.4 mile long tunnel. We had to wear headlamps (I carried my knuckle lights) and were warned our watches may not work. It was a nice way to start the race: you definitely didn’t go out too fast! I distanced myself a bit from the 3:35 pace group because who wants to be running in a tight pack in a tunnel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same point in the tunnel there was a symphony of beeps, so it seemed like the GPS signal wasn’t completely lost. Sure enough, shortly after I left the tunnel there was the 3 mile marker, and my watch wasnt too far off. I hit the lap button anyway just to sync up with their markers (my watch is notoriously ‘off’). Already 10% done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M1: 8:26&lt;br /&gt;
M2: 8:52&lt;br /&gt;
M3: 8:39&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a perfect day: slightly cool, and the course was gorgeous. Wildflowers and greenery. I chatted a bit with a runner next to me; he was on state #21. We compared races and marveled at how great this course was. We ran together for several miles, though we were ticking off miles faster than I would have liked (someone around us mentioned running 7:30s! I said that I hadn’t planned on seeing anything that started with a 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M4: 7:59&lt;br /&gt;
M5: 7:49&lt;br /&gt;
M6: 7:47&lt;br /&gt;
M7: 7:48&lt;br /&gt;
M8: 7:41&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My running buddy wasnt carrying water and he commented on how there wasnt much support on the course. I agreed (aid stations were 2-3 miles apart) and at the next water station he stopped “to make the most of it”. It took him probably a couple miles to catch back up. I was just enjoying the feeling of the course pulling me forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t quite know when I shifted my goal: pretty quickly I think. I realized that once we’d gotten out of the tunnel I was cruising, well ahead of the 3:35 pace group and feeling amazing. I’d had a great training cycle, and an online marathon pace converter had said the 3:47 run I’d done in Maui was the equivalent of a 3:30 on this course. So I figured I would watch my pace and see if a 3:30 (8mm) was in the cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had felt like I bonked at Harmon, and suspected it was because I tried to run with Tailwind rather than gels. So I took a half a huma gel every 5-6 miles to stave off any hunger or crash. I also tried to drink pretty regularly, including stopping at aid stations to top off my water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M9: 7:53&lt;br /&gt;
M10: 7:58&lt;br /&gt;
M11: 8:22 (water stop!)&lt;/p&gt;

It would have been a great course to stop and take photos during.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about the Advanced Marathoning plan is the midweek long runs, because the miles really seem to tick by on race day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M12: 7:43&lt;br /&gt;
M13: 7:56&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before too long we were at the halfway mark! I thought about Sara, who’d taken off from that point just shy of 2 hours prior. I hoped she was having as great a day as I was, and was close to the finish. I was still feeling pretty good, but I decided to turn on my running playlist to keep my energy high. I turned on my bluetooth headphones, which happily chirped that they connected to my MacBook Pro. You know, the computer back in Denver… sigh. I ran along trying to get them to pair to my phone, which happened after a few tries. I didn’t want to stop to adjust, but I also didn’t want to fall on my face. Thankfully, I got things going with only a slight pause, and immediately felt a little lift from the high-energy tunes. My right earbud felt a little weird so I took it out and only wore the left. That also felt more responsible and less dismissive of our beautiful setting than having them both in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M14: 8:03 (messing with my phone)&lt;br /&gt;
M15: 7:56&lt;br /&gt;
M16: 7:37&lt;br /&gt;
M17: 7:59&lt;br /&gt;
M18: 7:49&lt;br /&gt;
The miles continued to tick away, and I was grateful that doing math with 8 minute miles is so easy. 15 miles down is 80min + 40 min. 2 hours: check. 8 miles to go is 64 minutes to go. Cool. I generically give myself 2 minutes to finish the last .2 of the race, so at 20 miles I checked my watch to see how I’d do if I ran 50 minutes for the last 10K. Things were looking pretty close, but whenever I checked, things were looking pretty good. In all, I think there was a single time when I looked at my watch and thought “oh man, I need to pick it up!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at my splits, I can see where I stopped for water, but I always picked it back up to balance out that time. This was what races are supposed to feel like – just running to my abilities. I haven’t had a race like this since before my knee surgery. It was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M19: 8:12 (water)&lt;br /&gt;
M20: 7:39&lt;br /&gt;
M21: 7:51&lt;br /&gt;
M22: 8:00 (water)&lt;br /&gt;
M23: 7:54&lt;br /&gt;
M24: 7:57&lt;br /&gt;
M25: 8:06&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed a girl (who was accompanied by her boyfriend on a bike) for most of the second half of the course. She was a consistent distance ahead of me, and at around mile 23 I started psyching myself up. When we had a mile to go, I was going to put the hammer down and pass her, because she was struggling and I was feeling great. (This may not have been true, but the power of positive thinking!). During the 24th mile, I started preparing myself. I knew I was going to be close to 3:30, and while it didn’t ACTUALLY matter if I hit that goal, I told myself I wanted to push it and be sure to cover the last 1.2 in less than 10 minutes. When I hit the 25th mile marker, I started to ease into it. I didn’t want to gas myself, but I picked it up. I cruised by the girl (who cheerily called out that I was doing great – very nice of her!). I glanced at my watch and it was around a 7:30 pace. Nice!! Much faster than I needed to be doing, but it didn’t feel like a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M26: 7:21&lt;br /&gt;
Last .2: 7:09 pace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to turn a corner and see a finishing chute ahead of me. I cruised into the finish (sadly, there were no other women ahead of me, because that always provides a tiny bit of added incentive). The timing clock said 3:31 but I knew my chip time was faster. As I crossed the line, the announcer called out “Andrea Hill – who just qualified to register for Boston!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came through the chute, stopped running and oof, my legs felt like jello. They had been fine while I was running, but once the 2000ft descent was over, they felt pretty wobbly. Sara came over right away and I was thrilled to hear she’d met her goal of breaking 2 hours! What a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My official chip time was &lt;strong&gt;3:29:13&lt;/strong&gt;: a “post-surgery” PR of over 7 minutes, and my second-fastest marathon ever! Andrea came across the line at 4:02, which was an 8 min PR for her as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took some photos and gathered our stuff – I missed placing in my age group by about 30 seconds, but I’m still thrilled with how the day went. We stopped for lunch and I was surprised by how good I felt for the rest of the day. My last few races I’ve felt slightly nauseated afterwards, but in this case I felt surprisingly great. I was even the one to suggest an afternoon beer; often after a race I can’t imagine having a drink. I started to get a bit of a headache around 5pm but nothing an Advil couldn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/finishers.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5189 size-large&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/finishers-1024x740.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;448&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/finishers-1024x740.jpg 1024w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/finishers-300x217.jpg 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/finishers-768x555.jpg 768w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/finishers.jpg 1376w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night we relaxed and watched “Patriot’s Day”, and I’ll admit I definitely started thinking that I just may have to return to Boston in 2018. It is, after all, Meredith’s 40th birthday party, and I’m sure to get in since I beat my qualifying time by over 15 minutes (!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told my Mom that if she doesn’t break five hours at the Phoenix Marathon in February, this is a great course for a PR. I’m both excited and conflicted about this race: it was so perfect that I just don’t know how others will compare. I feel like the stars aligned and I had an amazing race, and I’m just not sure if I’ll ever be able to do so well again. Sara assured me that even if the course helped, I was the one who actually ran that pace for that distance, so I should give myself some credit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jack_and_Jill_Downhill_Marathon___Run___Strava-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-5201&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jack_and_Jill_Downhill_Marathon___Run___Strava-1-1024x543.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;329&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jack_and_Jill_Downhill_Marathon___Run___Strava-1-1024x543.jpg 1024w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jack_and_Jill_Downhill_Marathon___Run___Strava-1-300x159.jpg 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jack_and_Jill_Downhill_Marathon___Run___Strava-1-768x408.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But although I’d love to keep this race a secret, I feel like I owe it to the running community to tell them that whether you want a fast race or a beautiful one, this is the course for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next year? (If we can get in….)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrea Hill</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">About a year and a half ago, a friend told us about a race she’d heard about: the Jack and Jill Downhill Marathon. It was in Washington State (a state I didn’t have yet) and was supposed to be beautiful and fast. I was interested, but the timing wasn’t right for last year. She ran the race and told us she’d definitely run it again if we were interested. So when registration opened up (they held the race twice over the weekend since it was so popular), we were quick to register.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Shared_album_-_Sara_McWhorter__Andrea_Hill_-_Google_Photos.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Harmon Lake Trail Marathon Race Report</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/gothedistance/2017/06/harmon-lake-trail-marathon-race-report/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Harmon Lake Trail Marathon Race Report" /><published>2017-06-26T08:32:37-04:00</published><updated>2017-06-26T08:32:37-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/gothedistance/2017/06/harmon-lake-trail-marathon-race-report</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gothedistance/2017/06/harmon-lake-trail-marathon-race-report/">&lt;p&gt;Small races = friendly faces!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend Sara and I flew to North Dakota to meet my parents and run races associated with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gritevents.com/runnd-summer/&quot;&gt;Harmon Lake Trail Festival&lt;/a&gt;. This small festival is only a few years old and entry fee was CHEAP – we each paid $10 for our half- and marathon race entries because we were among the first few registrants. My mom actually had to pay more ($35!) to run the 15K 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We weren’t quite sure what to expect from this race: last year there were only 7 marathon finishers. The single woman who ran completed it in 4:52. But looking at the course profile it didn’t seem like anything we couldn’t handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2016_RunND_Trail_Race_Half___Full_Marathon_in_Mandan__ND__United_States___MapMyRun.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5167&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2016_RunND_Trail_Race_Half___Full_Marathon_in_Mandan__ND__United_States___MapMyRun-300x262.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2016_RunND_Trail_Race_Half___Full_Marathon_in_Mandan__ND__United_States___MapMyRun-300x262.png 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2016_RunND_Trail_Race_Half___Full_Marathon_in_Mandan__ND__United_States___MapMyRun-768x670.png 768w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2016_RunND_Trail_Race_Half___Full_Marathon_in_Mandan__ND__United_States___MapMyRun-1024x894.png 1024w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2016_RunND_Trail_Race_Half___Full_Marathon_in_Mandan__ND__United_States___MapMyRun.png 1290w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Bismarck Thursday night and met my parents, who’d driven down from Canada. We were pleasantly surprised by the food in Bismarck, and not-so-pleasantly surprised at the wind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-5168&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-300x231.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;231&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-300x231.png 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-768x592.png 768w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-1024x789.png 1024w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos.png 1376w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race was about a half hour from our Airbnb, and we just waited until race day morning to pick up our packets. It was a pretty low-key affair, which was cool. My race started at 7:45 and we were able to pull up at 7:20 and pick up everything right away. Snapped a couple pictures and it was time to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marathon course was two loops of the half-marathon course, with two unmanned aid stations and one manned aid station along each loop. I carried my Nathan vest with Tailwind (caffeinated) and a huma gel. I also brought along Advil and chapstick. The wind wasnt too bad when we started, so I just wore a tank top, lululemon shorts (of course!) my compression socks, hokas and a buff. I didn’t want to risk a hat blowing away in the wind! I brought my phone and new headphones as well, but didn’t think I’d want to use them. I was looking forward to the beauty of the trail!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we lined up to start, you could tell people were sizing up the competition. There were 6 ladies at the start, one of whom was crowing about recently having won a local half marathon.. trying to psych us out? Not sure. The organizer asked which states people were from, and when I said Colorado, another guy cheered a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course was well-done; we started out a bit on the road before we hit the single-track trail, which let the small field spread out a bit. I ended up hitting the trail about 4th or 5th overall, and soon a voice behind me asked “where in Colorado?”. It turned out Ezra was from the Springs, here to knock off another state as he was trying to get 40 of the 50 states by the time he was 40. He was 37 and had completed 30, which made me question my priorities 🙂 We ran together for the entire first loop, which was great because the group was incredibly spread out. We chatted about which courses we’d run, what we had left, etc. It was really pleasant to have someone to run with! I could tell he was a a bit stronger than I was, which also made it great for me to follow behind him and just hold on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few miles of the loop were relatively flat, if more technical. The second half went out away from the lake and were may switchbacks on exposed trail. There was some wind, but it’s wasn’t too bad. In all the surface was pretty gentle on the legs, which was great. Not too rocky and technical, with some steady rollers. There were admittedly a few spots where we talked about how it may be less than pleasant on the second loop (hills, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-5169 alignright&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-1-300x212.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-1-300x212.png 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-1-768x543.png 768w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-1-1024x724.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marathoners started a half hour before the half marathoners and 15K runners, and we had one runner come tearing by us around mile 12. Oof!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when we crossed the halfway point around 1:57. Was a sub-4 really in the cards??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ha. Hahahahah. No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, it wasn’t a real surprise, I already felt I was working a bit hard, but it seemed immediate. We started the second loop by careening down a steep incline towards the path (where in loop 1 we’d followed the road, this time we went cross-country). Ezra made decent time down the hill but I basically stopped to walk and opened my gu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind markets itself as complete nutrition: you don’t need Gus or gels. I dont think I should have trusted it that much; I definitely felt a bit light-headed and “out-of-it” and think I needed other nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Ezra (who also seemed to have slowed his pace a bit) and felt ok, then he stopped at the unmanned aid station (2.5 miles into the second lap). I kept going, and eventually he caught me and I let him pass. He’d also taken a rest stop and he was looking strong. I let him take the lead.. and lead he did. I felt like I was basically in maintenance mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had passed the half at an 8:54 pace, and we had never seen any women anywhere behind us (the course wasn’t great for spotting others, but you got glances back now and then). I told myself that if I could maintain a 9:15 pace, that’d be great and I’d be sure to maintain the W (the win).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I told myself that really, 9:20 would be a fine pace too…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-5170&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-2-300x216.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-2-300x216.png 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-2-768x553.png 768w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-2-1024x737.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cant quite explain what happened: I guess just that I didn’t feel like I had any gas. Well, and my left hip flexor was giving me some trouble. I stopped and grabbed some coca-cola and an Oreo at the manned aid station (6.5 miles in). I did feel mentally ok: the miles were clicking off. “Only 10 miles to go!” “Only 8 miles to go” “Five left!” I just wasnt moving as quickly as the first loop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did let myself stop to take a couple pictures: it was a gorgeous course, and the wind had picked up and was definitely a factor the second loop. I’d get a peak at Ezra now and then ahead of me, but other than that I was on my own for most of the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wasnt going to make 4 hours (which was fine, I had never seriously set that as a goal), but I knew there was no way I wanted a woman to pass me! So I kept willing myself to keep going. I knew that if a woman passed me, there would be no way I could keep with her, so I didn’t want to let that happen! I just kept focusing on what lay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about a loop course is that you have some idea what lays ahead, so I knew as I was approaching the finish. I took a small walk break in the last half mile (!) before running into the finish. My watch said 4:08:38, but the timekeepers said 4:07:37, so I guess I’ll take that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-5172&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-4-236x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;236&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-4-236x300.png 236w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-4-768x975.png 768w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-4-806x1024.png 806w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-4.png 992w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a small race where most of the runners of the shorter distances had been finished for more than an hour, there was a pretty small crowd at the end. But that was great, because my finish line (where, yes, I came in first woman, fourth overall in the marathon) was high-fiving my dad while my wife and mom took pictures 😀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was presented with my award, grabbed some homemade cookies and watermelon and heard how the other #hillwomen had done. Mom got 2nd in her AG in the 15K and Sara got 3rd in the 39-and-under AG for the half! Nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5171&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-3-300x280.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-3-300x280.png 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-3-768x716.png 768w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-3-1024x954.png 1024w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Photo_-_Google_Photos-3.png 1202w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time it was around noon so we jumped in the car and headed for lunch. My hip flexor was SO SORE and my fingers were incredibly swollen – my ring almost looked like it was cutting off my circulation?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day we relaxed, and I had some trouble sleeping. I cant believe my hip – definitely need to do something about it when I get home. But in terms of feet and legs and everything else, I feel ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race was pretty fun: definitely challenging but it was a really pretty course. It felt like a race organized by runners (which it was), with great email updates in advance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am disappointed with how I felt like I bonked the second loop, and I honestly think nutrition played a big role. I’d never had caffeinated tailwind before and I felt like I was taking in air when I sipped it. It wasn’t too hot so I dont think I drank as much as I could/should have, and I still should have carried gels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if it was smart to run with Ezra the first time since it may have pooped me out for the second loop, but it was definitely nice to have that buffer of time and not be running all by myself for the whole race! That’s part of the joy of smaller races like this: I think people are more social and often have similar goals (50 states, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some other Denverites running different distances, and we were barely done racing when Val sent out a link to a race she’s doing next month. I think I’ll pass and focus my training on the Jack and Jill – I’d love not to board the struggle bus on one of these races sometime! 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

I definitely don’t remember the play-by-play, but I regret I never posted anything. Here we go!..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara has always wanted to get married in Hawaii, and I like to joke that when she first said “and I assume we’d schedule the wedding around a race”, I knew she was the one for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided on the Maui Oceanfront Marathon, which had an associated half marathon and looked to be much more scenic and enjoyable than something huge like Honolulu. We did plan our nuptials around the race: run on Sunday, recover on Monday, get married on Tuesday. I had told the race director about our plans and he actually offered to let us get married along the course. We politely declined 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in January, Hawaii is hot and humid. The race started at 5am, which meant a 3:15am bus pickup. I knew it would be hot, so I only wore a sportsbra and shorts and lathered on sunscreen. We would start in the pitch-black dark, and I used/carried my knuckle lights until mile 14!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-5200&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos-1024x695.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;421&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos-1024x695.jpg 1024w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos-300x204.jpg 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos-768x521.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race start was VERY cool, with a traditional Hawaiian blessing to kick off off the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of concern that there wasn’t going to be any electrolyte-replacement on the course (apparently the shipment hadn’t come in, and there aren’t any running stores on the island of Maui), but I had brought my own water bottle, salt tabs and even a HotShot shot to try to combat the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had trained pretty well for the race, although there was also the matter of training over the holidays, wedding planning, some insecurity around my work, AND the fact my father underwent heart surgery a few days before our trip. With all that in mind, I took pressure off myself completely and told myself to focus on being grateful for the ability to run, and not expect anything more from the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1__Andrea_F_Hill-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5208&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1__Andrea_F_Hill-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;518&quot; height=&quot;126&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1__Andrea_F_Hill-2.jpg 1020w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1__Andrea_F_Hill-2-300x73.jpg 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1__Andrea_F_Hill-2-768x187.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ha, and I was glad I did! The humidity was insane; despite the fact it was well before sunrise, I was wiping sweat off my back within the first several miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out aggressively, but knew pretty quickly that this wasn’t going to be my day. Which was fine. I had my camera, my Spotify playlist was mostly 90s tunes, and I was hoping to spot some whales!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-5204 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos-1-300x204.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos-1-300x204.jpg 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos-1-768x522.jpg 768w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Photo_in_Trip_to_Hawaii_-_Google_Photos-1-1024x696.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course ran along the highway, but it wasn’t too crowded with either people or vehicles until close to the end. There were fantastic aid stations (I think they were vying for some sort of charity award or something).  It was a long run that just gave me time to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was grateful for the ability to run. I was grateful to have an amazing soon-to-be-wife. I was grateful that we were able to come to Hawaii for a wedding, even if my parents weren’t able to make it. I was grateful that we had traveled to see my Dad the week before, as he went into surgery. I was grateful to have my brother and his family come to my wedding (we only see each other every few years!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The run took longer than expected, and it was hot, and hard. But it was pretty to run along the coast, looking for whales. (I didn’t see any; Sara did during the half).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine there are many ‘easy’ marathons in Hawaii; we met some folks in Kauai the following week who had run a race that was 16 laps of a 1.64 mile loop through a park. Oof! So this one at least was pretty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Maui_Oceanfront_Marathon___Run___Strava-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-large wp-image-5205&quot; src=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Maui_Oceanfront_Marathon___Run___Strava-1-1024x547.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;331&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Maui_Oceanfront_Marathon___Run___Strava-1-1024x547.jpg 1024w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Maui_Oceanfront_Marathon___Run___Strava-1-300x160.jpg 300w, http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Maui_Oceanfront_Marathon___Run___Strava-1-768x411.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, I ended up finishing in a respectable 3:47:56, so I absolutely have nothing to complain about! [although for the record, it was about 1.5 min per mile slower than Houston…]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one more happy memory from an amazing wedding and honeymoon trip &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
