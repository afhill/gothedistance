        <p>Coming back from injury after my DNF at the RnRAZ race has actually been good. I‚Äôve been eating great and hitting the gym and boot camp a lot. After last week‚Äôs <a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2011/02/valentines-day-5k-race-report/">5K PR</a>, I toyed with the idea of doing a local 5 mile race. I waited to run until Thursday, when I pulled off a 7:30 paced 3 miler around my neighbourhood, complete with sprints, without even paying attention to my watch. After that, I decided I wanted to run the <a href="http://winterdistanceseries.com/Snowman/">Snowman Stampede 5M Race</a>.</p>

<p>Friday night I checked my old PR (37:05 ‚Äì 7:25mm) and read all my old race reports. Just reading them I had a sense that I was in a good position to kill it. I actually almost <a href="http://twitter.com/afhill262">tweeted</a> ‚Äúwatch out 5mile PR, I have my sights on you‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt want to be too cocky üôÇ Again, these past two weeks my race distance is the longest I‚Äôve run since my injury.</p>

<p>Saturday morning I woke up at 4 am for no good reason, but it gave me time to fuel and get ready for the run. I did 100 squats (it started out to be a test for the <a href="http://twohundredsquats.com/">200 squat challenge</a> ‚Äì once I hit 100, I decided I don‚Äôt need to take the challenge) and stretches for my hamstrings. It was nice and sunny out, so I decided to wear a tank top and shorts. Really, I need not to be an amateur with this stuff and remember to at least pack gloves ‚Äì I was a bit chilly before the race started.</p>

<p>I was happy to see a timing mat at the starting line, unlike last week. Still, I lined up close to the front so as to avoid dodging too many folks. I told myself that I‚Äôd be happy with a 7:15 pace, and soon enough we were off!</p>

<p>When I moved here, someone told me it takes 2 years to get used to the altitude. I don‚Äôt know if derby or speedwork or boot camp or nutrition have changed the runner I am. But I settled into an almost-comfortable-well-let‚Äôs-call-it-easily-sustainable pace reasonably quickly.</p>

<p>M1: 7:05 / avgHR 168<br />
I glanced at my watch at the first mile, but it was more out of interest than monitoring. This was how it was last week as well: I‚Äôm not running against the clock, I‚Äôm running according to my body. I didnt feel like I was taxing myself too much that I‚Äôd pay for later, so I just kept trucking.</p>

<p>M2: 7:08 / avgHR 181<br />
There was a cold headwind for the first half of the race, but I felt good. The course is one I‚Äôve run and ridden my bike on frequently as it connects to the trail by my house.</p>

<p>M3: 7:06 / avgHR 179<br />
And soon enough we were at the turn around! I counted several women ahead of me but didn‚Äôt pay attention to my actual place. I‚Äôve done that a few times and I think it takes me a bit out of the zone I need to be in. I know some people don‚Äôt like out and back courses, but I do. I knew the way and let my feet lead. I felt so strong, it still seemed close to effortless. It was on the way back that I started to pass a few folks.</p>

<p>M4: 6:57 / avgHR 182<br />
I saw a woman up ahead and set my sights on her. I actually didn‚Äôt plan to pass her so quickly, but most folks weren‚Äôt picking up speed like I was. I did see another woman ahead who was holding strong, and I kept my sights on her.</p>

<p>M5: 6:49 / avgHR 185<br />
The last mile had a bit of a hill and some twists and turns on unpaved road and rocks. It was a bit of an annoying finish as the woman ahead of me stayed strong. Finally we were in the final stretch and I saw her accelerate and I couldn‚Äôt catch up. But, there was the finishing clock, with 34:xx! The minutes clicked over to 35.xx as I crossed the line, feeling strong and happy.</p>

<p>Final: 35:05 ‚Äì 7:01 pace. A 2 minute PR (24 seconds per mile improvement!)</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd looked at my watch since mile 2, so it was pretty exciting to see my final time. What a huge PR! I treated myself to a melting pot sampler (pineapple, cheesecake, marshmallow, strawberry and chocolate to dip it in). Then they posted the results, and I got 2nd in my age group! (actually I got third, but the first place woman won the whole race so she was ineligible for AG awards). I collected my $15 gift certificate from a local running store (perfect! I need new shoes) and then headed home. I actually jumped on my bike and rode for a few miles, keeping the legs moving and getting them worked out. I was ravenous for the rest of the day (ok, so I may be hungry a lot now regardless) and made sure to eat healthy to refuel. Later in the evening was the Denver Roller Dolls bout and afterparty where I danced, but my left knee was a bit sore. I‚Äôll need to watch that! While I‚Äôm working on correcting my gait and balance, I anticipate it‚Äôll take my ole knee some time to adapt. That‚Äôs honestly why I haven‚Äôt purchased new shoes yet, I want to get things figured out regarding my stride first.</p>

<p>This was seriously such a great race. It felt like a marathon, effort-wise. I didn‚Äôt kill myself and hate myself through part of the race. I definitely pushed at the end but I had good even effort. Hrm, think having good clean-burning fuel instead of simple carbs helps with that? As I ran, I thought about the tremendous improvement I‚Äôve already seen this year, and it made me look forward a bit. I have a guaranteed entry to the Colfax Marathon on May 15th, but I‚Äôm not going to run that. But I only missed the NYCM half marathon qualifying standard by 1:44 last year, I feel like I could take it this year. That‚Äôs a 7:24 pace and based on how easy this 5 miles at 7:01 felt, I feel pretty confident. Something to think about..</p>

<p>I‚Äôm trying hard not to figure out what to race next weekend, really hard.. but I know I need not to get too caught up in racing and make sure I‚Äôm doing the training I need to perform as I want. But I told myself this was a year of short distances, and I can‚Äôt believe how much I‚Äôm actually looking forward to it!</p>
