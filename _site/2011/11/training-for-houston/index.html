        <p>Yesterday on my run, one of my teammates asked if I was training for something specific. I said I had two marathons in January.</p>

<p>So after 7 years of marathons, I think it’s time to admit: there is a difference between “planning to run” and “training”. For a long time, I saw them as the same, as “training” was really about getting in the miles to ensure I could finish. Heck, sometimes I didn’t even do that (remember the Big Sur marathon, when I hadn’t run over 13 miles in the 3 months preceding the race?)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/40YearMarathonRightColumnLogo.gif"><img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/40YearMarathonRightColumnLogo.gif" alt="" title="40YearMarathonRightColumnLogo" width="200" height="117" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2996" /></a>As my goals shift from completion to quality performances, so too must my attitude. I have two races in January, yes. But I don’t plan to do anything spectacular for Disney: that’s an experiential event. I DO however want to do well in Houston. I’ve blown away so many PRs in the past 12 months, but that’s one distance I haven’t put a <a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2008/10/ready-to-start-training/">serious training effort</a> toward since training for Rock n Roll AZ in <a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/01/rock-and-roll-arizona-race-report/">January 2009</a>.</p>

<p>Wow.. THREE years? I actually originally wrote January 2010 and had to go back and check the date.</p>

<p>Sure enough, a glance at my <a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/race-resume/">race resume</a> shows a bunch of races (I count 10) since then, but I can’t honestly say I followed any sort of serious regimen to try to do well. I was running, but not training.</p>

<p>The final time we all <a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/09/a-belated-boston-marathon-race-report/">ran Boston</a> was in 2009. I hadn’t particularly trained for it, and Helen and I both ran reasonably well (~3:47). Meanwhile, Meredith ran a <a href="http://meredithrunningworld.blogspot.com/2009/04/boston-marathon-2009.html">BIG PR</a> (it’s still the fastest marathon between the two of us, on any course). She’d recently started working with a coach, and was mentally and physically prepared to kick butt. I was happy for her, but she said something after the race that bothered me(apparently – it’s over 2 years later). She said something along the lines of “maybe if you and Helen ran fewer races, you’d do better”. Now, I love to run and race, so I dismissed it. At the end of that marathon, we were excitedly going over our plans for our next big race together, <a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2009/08/pikes-peak-marathon-race-report/">Pikes Peak</a>!</p>

<p>If I’d trained and peaked for Boston, and left it all on the course, I don’t know I’d have been emotionally ready to discuss the next big thing. But perhaps that’s why there is a difference between training for and planning to run. Pikes Peak (a lot of the races Helen and I have done over the years) is for the joy of running, not to try to achieve a particular goal. I thankfully recover quickly, so I have been able to run <a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2005/10/detroit-free-press-marathon-report/">multiple marathons</a> back-to-back, so I think as long as I’m smart in Disney, I won’t compromise Houston.</p>

<p>So, a long story to say that I’m running Disney, but I’m training for Houston. Although it’s not a huge shift, that means I am going to orient my thinking and my training a bit more towards that following weekend, and mentally prepare myself to do more than just run. Disney will be something to enjoy, but I don’t want it to detract at all from what I have in mind for January 15, 2012.</p>

<p>After that I have a few more races I’m planning to run, but so far I don’t have anything I’ve set sights on to really train for. I want to see what I can do now in Houston, and then be able to see how much further my training group can take me.</p>
