        <p>The Four on the Fourth 4K was my second race of the day, and third within five days. A week prior, Darren had recommended I run this race and gave me a goal of a 6:20 pace. I’m not entirely sure if he’d been considering the other races when he came up with that number.. generally he has us not run at all the week following a marathon, much less race?? Oh well, I figured I’d go out and see what my legs could do!</p>

<p>I drove right from the <a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/07/the-superior-downhill-mile-race-report/" title="The Superior Downhill Mile Race Report">Downhill Mile</a> to the start of this race, but there was a good hour to settle down before starting again. I didn’t eat between the races, but I had some Monster Amino and kombucha. I changed from my Hokas to my Brooks racers, and met up with some of the RRBs: Steve Fether, Fred, Sarah and Rick and Laura Bruess were all racing.</p>

<p>As we headed to the start, the other racers were sizing up their competition. Apparently lots of folks come out to this race, sponsored by <a href="http://averybrewing.com/">Avery Brewing</a>, for the prizes. Age group winners get a case of beer, and second and third place take home 2 6-packs. There was also a prize for the fastest combined time between the Downhill mile and this one, but I saw plenty of familiar backs and knew I had no chance for that. (Backs rather than faces because they were ahead of me!)</p>

<p>I didn’t realize this race wasn’t chip-timed until it was too late and I was too far back in the crowd to do anything about it. So when we started, I was dodging and expending energy trying to get around folks. It had also started to get pretty toasty!</p>

<p>I knew Darren had set a goal of 6:20 pace for me, but I realized that I had no idea what that actually meant in terms of overall time. How long is 4K anyway??? I kept myself busy trying to do some rough math for awhile.</p>

<p>The course had a lot of sharp turns, so it wasn’t exactly the fastest. I hit the first mile at 6:22, which was fine. I didn’t feel like 6:20s were in the cards for today, but I was just marvelling that my legs were doing ok! My second mile was in 6:31. The next bit of the course was uphill again and I found myself struggling. My legs were ok but I just didn’t have that oomph I needed. I had passed Rick just before mile 2 and he caught up and encouraged me to keep going, which helped! I picked it up for the last quarter mile or so and cruised in for an overall time of 16:23 (6:36mm).</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, I was 14th female. I placed 14th in the Leadville marathon Saturday, and although I didn’t know it at the time, I’d also been 14th in the mile in the morning. How odd?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fourfourth.png"><img src="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/fourfourth.png" alt="" title="fourfourth" width="277" height="369" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4181" /></a>The best part was when results were posted, and I placed 2nd in my age group – beer for me! All the RRBs did great, actually:</p>

<p>Sarah – 4th overall, 2nd in her AG<br />
Laura – 1st in her AG with a new course record<br />
Fred – 2nd in his AG<br />
Steve – 2nd in his AG</p>

<p>There was a nice spread of food and free beer for runners, which was a nice way to relax after some hard running! I did have some beer despite the fact I know my <a href="http://www.afhill.com/gothedistance/2012/07/living-gluten-free/" title="Living Gluten-Free">body doesn’t like it</a>, which was dumb. I spent part of the afternoon miserable in bed, a combination of the heat and a ridiculous headache, to the point where I actually got sick. So, my roommates will enjoy my winnings…!</p>

<p>Although I didn’t meet the goal Darren had thrown out, I’m really happy with how the race went. I honestly wasn’t sure if my legs would be ok if I tried to put in a hard effort. I can’t help but think those nice cushy Hokas I wore Saturday made a difference…. my heart rate got up to 191 in this race, which was actually higher than in the mile in the morning!</p>
